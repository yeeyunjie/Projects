"I’m 20 years old and started playing Basketball 3 years ago. Despite playing for three years I am pretty much terrible. My main goal is to play overseas in 6-7 years from now. Whenever I play games like 21 or 1 on 1 I’m a much better player. But when it comes to 2 on 2, 3 on 3, or full court, I perform terribly. Most of the time, it’s because I have anxiety and don’t do stuff I learn in games, especially when I get pressured I make mistakes. I also play rather “robotic” and not really shifty.This year, I’m gonna work hard on not only my game but my fitness as well. I was wondering how long it took for you guys to stop being scared in games, and how to become less robotic in games?",1

"I just bought a new basketball intended for outdoor use, I went with the Molten BG3200 Indoor/Outdoor Composite. My issue is that it doesn't have enough bounce - I really have to pound it hard to get it back up. I've inflated it to the point of almost overinflating it just to get enough bounce out of it, any less and it just won't bounce. Will it get better with time? Is it simply an issue of the ball having to be played in? Does anyone have experience with these balls? Appreciative of any help.",1
"First I want to ask is this normal. If it is how could I get a “cure”  or how to stop the pain.Second how common is this? every single practice/game/tryout, I would have this pain.

"Increasing verticalHey, I was looking for some guidance on increasing my vertical. Right now I can dunk by palming the ball, (6’6) however I get rim stuffed when I dunk while cradling the ball and dunking, I literally just need ~2 inches to get up there since I’m so close.I understand that Bulgarian squats are really good, and lunges are good for vertical, but how often should I be doing these excercises, and how long would it take to increase my vertical by 1 or 2 inches?Thanks, any help is appreciatedTLDR: how long would it take to increase a vertical by 2 inches and frequency and amount of time worked on vertical",1

"I'm an engineering student working on project to create an automated court contact detection system intended to alert referees when a player in possession of the ball steps out of bounds, or the ball contacts the court out of bounds. Part of this project involves gathering information from the end-users (in this case, refs). So, if anyone who has experience refereeing basketball (at any level of the game) would be willing to fill out the a short questionnaire I put together that has some questions about what refs would like from such a system, I'd really appreciate it. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete.",1
"After eight years of playing soccer i realised its not the sport for me and I’m deciding to take up basketball when the new season starts here in ireland. Im 6’5 wearing shoes and would consider myself above average in terms of athleticism. I feel really enthusiastic to just play basketball and have started to go and train alone for around 3-4 hours a day. I’ve improved my shot in the first and only week so far of training. I can dunk the ball pretty easily as-well but that can only do so much for me, if anything at all. I understand that there is many aspects to basketball and that i have a ridiculous amount to learn but for once I’m willing to put in the effort and the hours. I hope this goal isn’t too unrealistic and would like some thoughts and opinions.",1

Please help with the noise of my basketball practice,1
"Before i start just wanted to give a little background info on me. I'm 18, 6 3"" 180lbs with a very average reach. I've always played varsity hoops through High School but never had the athleticism to get to the next level. I touched the rim for the first time at 14 when i was 5 10.  I got my first real dunk without dribbling at 16 when i was 6 2"". I've been able to do pretty lame dunks since then but when the pandemic started and with so much free time i decided to try and really increase my vert. Now in the past i tried 2 or 3 times legitimately to increase my vert with 0 results. I am going to tell you my tips and tricks that took me from barely grazing the rim, to tomahawking and reversing.* 1: You can't just do a million calf raisesI watched every single video on youtube on **""how to increase your vert by 9 inches in 3 minutes""** Now some of these vids have decent advice, gimicky stuff won't work. Trust me, I've tried.*  2: You have to fully commit to working out your entire bodyThe few times in the past i tried to increase my vert i worked out exclusively my legs with little other full body work. Now I know this may make me not sound credible anymore but i was young and naive when i tried that approach. To fully increase vertical, set a workout plan and hit the weights. There inst a full body workout that won't help your overall fitness, which translates to your jumping ability.* 3: Learn the proper formIf you aren't naturally a good jumper, form is essential. I increased my own vert by at least 4 or 5 inches by just getting perfect form. To do this either watch tutorials, (THINCPRO Basketballs videos helped me a lot) or watch nba players or pro dunkers and try and emulate their approach. Getting good form is awkward and time consuming, but also the easiest way to increase your vert.* 4: Start Low with a small ballNow not everyone has access to a low rim, but try and find one if you can. Its the best way to practice form and footwork. If you don't have an adjustable rim, find a school or park with a smaller net and work there. I still always warm up on a low rim. Don't start with a 29.5 sized ball either. Work your way up from a golf ball to an nba ball* 5: Dunk every dayThis tip may sound stupid, but it is what brought me from barely dunking, to yamming over guys. Over the past 6 months i dunk for about 45 minutes to an hour straight every day. Low rim, high rim, doesn't matter, like any athletic ability, repetition is key to sucess!These 5 super simple steps take a lot of hard work, but helped increase my vertical over 8 inches. If you want any personal advice please private message me and ill give you whatever knowledge i have!",1

Have been seeing young guys on here A LOT recently asking about how to get a better vert and the answer is jump. A lot. And there is so much more to do with training your legs to stay healthy. Bulletproofing your knees. But just understand from a guy who has been there.  I got to being able to dunk and honestly it was amazing to achieve but as far as what I got out of it in game is minuscule in comparison to working on consistent shot form. Dribbling and finishing around the rim. Not to mention PASSING and knowing spacing on the court.  Watched LeVert play last night and he is absolutely astounding as a finisher.  I know he is 6’6” and that doesn’t hurt but he isn’t jumping out the room or over defenses to finish. He is understanding ball man you position and utilizing positioning to get shots up close to the rim.  I know it is amazing to fly through the air and I am not so old I forget the want and desire I too felt when I was young but if you train jumping you’ll gain vert. It’s that simple. A lot of the other stuff is way more important and nuanced and deserves much more of your time. Good lunch and gods speed.,1

So I was wondering I really feel the side affects of basketball too much whilst and after for a long time. For example if I go out on a Saturday I am too tired to go out on Sunday as my legs ache and sometimes even a few days after Sunday I can’t. Maybe is it because I stay out too long or is because my body is too weak to support my size. And if my body is too big what exercise should I do? Thanks for reading this.,1

"Hello everyone It's my first post in this page and I'd like to say well done to everyone for keeping a page like this for the sport we love with such a great community. To get straight to the point, recently I've been having issues with my waist.  I know the 'cause' and I'll try to either replace it with different exercises or apply perfect technique next time. However at this point I need to cure the pain as fast as I can because it's curcial period as the basketball preparation begins. It all happens ( in most cases ) after I do planks but also ( it makes it worse possibly ) when I get a bit lower and have 1 ball on each hand and dribble. I do this in stationary position or while doing steps ahead n then back again. So the previous weeks I noticed I had some light pain on my waist the next day after I had done planks last night ( just one set for 20-25 sec. ) It is manageable in this pain level but last Friday I did both of these exercises and got this light pain on my waist again. I took a day off from training on Saturday and last night I went to train again but unfortunately I did the exercise with the double dribbling while staying low or maybe benting a little bit your waist ( with wrong technique I guess ). I have some scoliosis and kyphosis ( medium level though ) not sure if that's making it worse in some situations like this. The feeling of the pain is like when you kind of lift some heavy weight and your waist-lower back starts getting sore immediately, like a lumbago (?) or while playing game and doing a quick 'harsh' move and your waist gets very painful suddenly. It feels painful when bending ( either  a little or very much ) and when you pull your leg up etc. Problem is it got worse since last night and that was my mistake, so my question now is should I apply hot water etc. to the area or expose it to the sun for fastest results? I never take meds so I'd like to follow natural ways only if that's possible. Making it obvious I won't try these exercises again ( untill it gets cured ) on training, should I stop completely and let 2-3 days off at least or keep some light running and ball play without bending my body? How would you advise me about that? Any help or oppinion is greatly appreciated.Thank you very much in advance.",1

I’ve taken up boxing and it hurts way less than even some 2v2’s and it just sucks. It’s like my body can’t take the impact I give it and maybe it’s bc I use running shoes, but idk what’s wrong with my lower body. Is my body just not made for basketball or like wtf is up, bc most of my friends can’t relate and I can’t even imagine playing like more than 2 games in a day or even playing more than once a week, and like I said I just stopped going to play bc it hurts my knees and legs so bad.",1

"I love basketball. It is probably my second or favorite sport, in contention with the great American pastime.But I can’t follow the NBA. It’s *waaaay* to, idk, corporate I guess. Also, I never associated basketball with sports professionalism, I always associated basketball with school, which is why I *love* high school and college basketball. I’d rather go to a local basketball game than an NBA game, even if it isn’t my alma mater. The fact these kids chose these schools, especially college basketball, really makes it more appealing to me with the sense of pride these kids have when they play. Also the student environment is so *basketball* in my opinion, and I have yet to see something close to that energy in the NBA.",1

"Not sure if this has been posted before but it’s been bothering me seeing a lot of people on here and other online posts saying certain NBA players (shorter) can’t dunk. However, I believe that every NBA player can dunk if they wanted to. People may try to make the argument that “Nate Robinson, IT, Spudd Webb could only dunk because they were super athletic”. However, they disregard the fact that to make the NBA at that height, it is imperative that they will be extremely athletic! A little background, I am on the shorter side (5’10) playing at the college level, and most guys my height (and shorter) have no problem dunking (even if off a lob). Not only at the college level are people below 6’ dunking, but even in high school. If high school kids are able to slam it with ease, wouldn’t it be obvious that an NBA player would be able to dunk? Therefore, with NBA training and athleticism, it is clear that every NBA player can dunk if they wished to.",1

"Wanted to share a short piece I wrote.As a basketball fan, this sucks. For myself, and so many others, watching NBA basketball has always been a way to escape. A way to escape the adversity and hardships in our daily life, and the inherent pain and suffering that we all experience as human beings. The NBA allowed me to dream like a kid again, to dream of my childhood team winning a championship, to dream that I could soar like Michael Jordan or LeBron James. But, my favorite thing about the NBA and sports, is the way that it brings people together. People from all walks of life, united, regardless of color or religion, rooting for one purpose. The chance to win.As a basketball fan, this sucks. In times like these, with the kind of year that *we all* have had, we needed sports. We needed an escape, now, more than ever. We desperately needed a reminder, of what it was like to hope, to believe, and to dream again. I wish that the NBA would continue on so that I could continue to escape reality and continue living in the comfort of my own bubble. But, that would be taking the easy way out. The reality is, we would never grow, evolve, or improve if we never left our comfort zones and turned a blind eye to issues that made us feel sad or uncomfortable.So yes, as a basketball fan, this sucks. But this is bigger than basketball. Our country needs change, now, more than ever. And we are so fortunate to have such a powerful organization in the NBA, to have the courage to take a stand, trailblaze a path for us all to follow, and inspire us to do everything within our power to incite the change we need.",1

So I’m having a problem with my jumper that I can notice I’m still using my left hand (my guide hand) so also propel the ball when I shoot. I tend to flick my thumb and use my left when I see all the great shooters not using their left at all. I’m a couple months past my 15th birthday and I’m worried that somehow I’m not strong enough to shoot with just my right. Do I need to sit in a weight room? Or do I need to sit there and do form shots and find a drill that’ll help me lose my left hands habits? Sorry for the long ass paragraphs but I’m curious and unsure about my jumper.,1

Well, imagine a device that has sensors all over the human body and the basketball. It’d know if you double dribble and travel. It judges a percentage of body contact you received as to whether or not something is a foul. We already have the technology in tennis on whether or not something is out of bounds.

"I only play pickup really but I need the basics of this shit broken down for me. I’m pretty embarrassed to be in my 20s and asking this but fuck it.My main skill is shooting and I feel super confident about it but everyone knows or can tell once they start playing with me. I can typically extend my range a few steps behind the 3 point line too but if a guy just stands in front of me and I have the ball I freeze. I can do just about everything else fine on the court but this, especially when my shots not dropping and my confidence is low I’ll literally just force a shot over my defender or pass it back. I have been practicing a strong dribble and pull-up but need much better ball handling in order to even take 2 strong dribbles. I’m above average height and feel like with my shooting the defender has to step way up and take my pump fakes seriously but I’m so far behind in my dribbling and driving that I feel like a fool sometimes. I’m also not that fast with the ball which hurts my confidence, but even my friends who aren’t that fast can get it done too so I know it’s not that big of a dealSo basically, what skills and mental things can I do to build confidence on my drives? Break this down how you do to kids and I’m willing to learn from the bottom up. Also are there individual drills or is it more mental in game where I have to just learn on the fly?",1

Can't shoot consistently (yet!) and can't create a shot for himself (unless maybe backing someone down, pump faking and taking it up)&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;Opponent #1 - 5'11 - Used to be the best out of our friend group but he's a baseball player. less consistent shooter after being rusty for a couple of months but is still athletic as hell and has long arms to get passing lanes. I'd probably compare him to pascal siakam.Opponent #2 - 5'9 - This is the guy who guards me. Hard to drive past because he uses his feet and body to bump me off (some of these could be blocking fouls lol) but nonetheless still hard to drive past him. Probably a little taller than my teammate. Can't shoot 3s but can knock down a mid-range and get past my teammate easily for a layup.&amp;#x200B;We lost our first match up today by 3 points.

I can get a shot over him in an iso, and I haven't really tried to drive on him since he's pretty athletic. I can't really drive past any of them since big guy cant shoot and the paint is clogged. All of this would be solved if I didn't lose my hot hand, and they would be forced to play up leaving the paint open for my teammate.

hi everyone. so i have always liked this game. i used to play in elementary. but i was not very good. and i never pursued it after that. but i still like to shoot hoops. so today i was riding my bike around my neighborhood.. and there is a park with a small court. and as i was riding by. i saw a group of guys playing. i rode by and then on my next pass i decided to sit and watch. at first i was parked in someones driveway. nobody was around and i figured if the owner of the house pulled in or came outside. then i would leave. but they never did. and then i decided to get a closer look and leave the persons driveway. i kept watching until they were done and left. so my question is. was that ok to do? im pretty sure legally it was fine since it was a park. but im wondering if the players thought it was ok. i am shy and not to good at talking to people. so i probably looked weird just sitting on my bike and watching. but it was so fun to watch. so have any of you encountered some watchers at the park? and how do you react or feel about it. i plan on doing it again. maybe i will work up the courage to ask next time.,1

And I’m Lowkey afraid to get into games with randoms because I don’t know where they’ve been, so I’m going with friends.

"All those hours of grinding...I am still not seeing the result in real games!Last month I attended a couple of basketball tournament, and I've found that I can't translate my skills in real games when playing against defenders on me. I am a guard and a very good ball handler that can pull up mid-range shots pretty well, but during the games I was frozen and my head went blank all the times against tough defenders and had to pass the ball to my teammate that can attack the rim. This has made me start doubting myself if I should not spend hours practice those drills alone and also made me start losing confidence recently because I feel like all those hours and grinds I've spent are not showing...The worst part is that I know my skills are better than many people out there but I am less useful when it comes to real games. This sucks.I practice alone a lot on daily basis after work, and I don't screw around just shoot for fun. I've been grinding my ass off. However, I rarely play real games with others. I know I should play more against people but most my teammates live far away and not many people play basketball in my hood... Please give some advises on how I can translate my skills into real games?. I want to play the way that I know I am capable of.  Thanks guys.",1

"I just play casually.I figured out rebounding, defense, shooting, and basic offense, but I'm not a good scorer.I can score well on 1v1, 2v2, 3v3. But when it comes to 5v5 I am terrible!Probably because there's less space to work with, less time to break down the defender and score, even if you beat your defender there's help defense and you don't know if your teammate will get open. Your defender can then play you close and you don't have space to shoot, and if you drive there's a help defender. And if I do too much dribbling or try to dribble around my defender, another defender will just reach in.It's the half court offense that kills me in 5v5 because there's no plays being run. On 5v5 I score on catch and shoot 3s, fast break finishes, offensive rebound put backs. And I will also just force it inside and if I miss just get my own rebound and put it in.Any tips? I feel like I need really good dribbling moves and to work on specific scoring moves that I can rely on in half court offense. Like, step back jumpers, fadeaways, and especially shooting off the dribble.I'm like a Danny Green on offense. Can't create my own shot, can make 3s, and can drive and score on fast breaks, or get put backs.TL;DR: I can score when there's a lot of space and time to create myshot in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. But in 5v5 my player defends the shot super close, and if I drive a help defender comes in and the paint is clogged. And there never seems to be enough space to work my defender off the dribble.

"My best guess is that by jumping before shooting they can focus more on the horizontal distance the ball travels rather than how high it goes, but surely it's more beneficial to combine arms with legs? There are many players who do this, so it would make more sense to give examples of those who don't, like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard.As for me, I prefer to shoot while jumping as opposed to after jumping, as I always seem to undershoot when I  do the latter. I feel like shooting midair just introduces another variable to keep track of, and I often lose balance (or maybe I'm just not athletic enough to pull shots like that off). Maybe height matters?Contrary to that, maybe my form is a bit off, so I would be accepting of any tips for shooting midair (since I am quite short and shooting over defenders would be beneficial)Any opinions and thoughts would be welcome :)",1

"I am a former semi-professional basketball player. I haven't been playing pro for a while now. However, I hurt my back while training. That said, even back in my playing days, I had back issues. However, this time it was the worse thing I ever experienced. The compound effect of continuing to work out and play sports at a high level eventually took its toll.I lost all control of my right leg as it was dead due to nerve damage, and I had severe pain in my lower back. I was meditating daily, sleeping on the ground in specific positions to relieve pain. I went and got an MRI, and I found out that I have an L4, L5, and S1 disc herniation (bulge). After hearing this news, I knew I couldn't ignore it any longer. I knew that I had to figure out what I could do to make it so that I'd never go in an MRI machine for my back again.I have a lot of negative emotions connected to my back injury. I was disabled, I had low confidence, I wasn't able to do simple things for family, friends and loved ones. I felt useless, and my self-worth was at an all-time low, and I felt utterly alone. I was searching high and low for a solution. Every day, I would scour the internet for anything. Someone to tell me, it was going to be okay, that if I just did X, Y and then Z, I would be healed. The good news is I ended up finding him, not online, but within. I realized that no one was going to come and help me. I had to take it upon myself, do the research, see what worked and what didn't work and bring it all together for a comprehensive plan for my daily life. This was not a one-time solution, but rather a change in lifestyle. Well, I am here today to tell you, the person reading this, that I did it. I was able to find the solution for me, and you can as well. I am writing this to let you know that you're not alone. I am here, and I want to help. I've just decided to help people. Because we all know that until you have a back injury, you just don't understand. **Tell me your story, tell me how you feel, talk about your pain, your life, how you manage day today. Ask me questions about anything! I'm here…** I'll end with this…My back injury taught me that no matter how bad an outcome maybe, I can always learn from it and come out on the other side with a different skill, perspective, or ideology. It taught me that things are ever-changing, and it is essential to go with the flow, accept your situation, and figure out how and what you can learn from it. I believe the quote from Bruce Lee encapsulates best what I mean, when he said, ""be like water.""",1

So I graduated from college this past spring and played a ton of pick up ball during my four years. I enjoyed getting better and just trying my best to execute during games. This corona virus and quarantine has obviously sucked for a lot of people for a lot of reasons. I spent two months not balling when quarantine started and when the weather got warmer I started practicing again but felt like I was far from what I had been. I’ve recently play put doors with a consistent group for a few weeks but all these guys have started going back to college and I find myself alone again. It’s really starting to bum me out because most of my friends from school are doing a 5th year and I can’t visit them or play ball with them due to the university restrictions. I’ve just felt so sad lately. I keep practicing on my own but it is starting to feel hollow without getting to play with anyone. I just don’t know what to do. I was wondering if anyone knew of any mens leagues that may be trying to start up again so maybe I have some hope? Thanks and hope y’all are safe and healthy,1

To be fair my high school is extremely competitive,1
I started this year around February training my vertical I was around 5 inches from the rim. I feel my vertical wasn’t bad it’s just because my standing reach is 7”7 with shoes meaning my vertical at the start was 24 inches. I can now 6 months later get around 3 inches above the rim and one time I got my whole hand above it. This means my vertical is now 32/33 consistently but 1 time i jumped 35. This means in 6 months I’ve gained 8+ inches. I measured the hoop and it was definitely 10 feet and I’ve always practiced on this hoop. However it is outdoors and the floor is now slippy as my shoes I use for outdoors have lost there grip. My indoor courts are re-opening in about a week and I was wondering will this help with my jump. And also if I continue grinding and jumping will my vertical reach the needed 36-37 inch mark this year in order to get my dunk and prove the people who said I’m too short wrong😂.Also A side question: can everyone palm a basketball with the correct training whether it be small or big hands because I feel my hands are fairly small and I can’t palm one as I feel it’s impossible. But I’m willing to train my hands if it is do-able.,1

"I don't know how you all feel, but in this playoff bubble the amount of arguing, whining, complaining, and flopping in basketball has just gotten out of control. It's been worse and worse each of the past 5-6 years but the lack of fans really highlights the ""extracurriculars"" going on. The refs get bombarded from a star player, go to the screen, rewatch the play, things change, get uncertain, the rhythm changes and the game is less about good plays and more about getting the refs on your side. It's really making it hard for me to watch. The refs made some controversial and downright wrong foul calls late in the games today (bucks/heat game 2 and game 7 rockets/thunder) , but I think it's largely from an endless barrage of criticism from players and coaches that they receive that makes their job even harder. Every year flopping is a bigger and bigger part of the game, and soon we'll be watching soccer on a court. What do y'all think?",1

It's the only tim I felt like I'm alive and my life feels awesome cause of it. Sure, the road is full of challenges. Sure, I don't have the talent to make it to that level I always fantasize about. But basketball's something that reminds me that not everything is full of shit. It's that one thing, that constant challenge that helps fill this emptiness inside of me. But I gotta come clean today. If I had control over my life like that, maybe I'd be able to have a healthier relationship. But sometimes you don't and you feel that craving. ""It was supposed to be this way but it wasn't that way and you can't do anything about it."" If I got to hoop during all those missed opportunities, maybe life would be different.

I always daydream about what it would be like if I were some hotshot in the league living the good life. I always get that reminder everyday that I'm not good enough. I play like it sometimes. I look good sometimes. But I'm barely good enough to even make varsity. I could, but with all this covid bullshit, maybe not this time. Some of it's on me. Mentally, my game is not always in the right place, and the reality is I suck. I just don't play like I suck, but I'm not elite and I doubt I'll ever be. Does that stop me from playing? No. But just that insecurity of not being good enough is what drives me to hit the weight room or get some shots up when I can. It's what guides me to get out there and gets me upset when I can't. It's easy to understand why you failed when you're the one who has to wipe your own ass. After all, I never understood hard work until now this year. It's not easy to do all the time, but IMO it's better than stuff not in your control getting in the way. I know I'm getting better; I can see the progress as I play. Unfortunately, it's always gotta be that stuff I can't control getting in the way. And that's what really does make me upset and addicted.Sorry I wasted everyone's time here. I really needed to get this off my chest. Maybe it's the fact that life's returning to normal over here. More school, more house chores, more family, and less basketball. I felt it. I felt it in quarantine, myself getting better. But today, I lost it. I lost all the confidence I had built up for months. I just don't feel the same anymore, and maybe it's because I wanna go back to the days of working out 2-3 times a day instead of once. You just feel your goals, your dreams in your grasp a bit, mayne not the NBA dream but the promise of freedom and a good life, then it slips away and goes farther than it was the last time.",1

"This is a message to youth coaches that want to try and help your kids grow as players. I coach Freshmen basketball, and one of the biggest hurdles I face each year is teaching kids how to play man-to-man defense. Within recent years, I’ve noticed that the majority of youth coaches exclusively teach zone defense, and kids usually aren’t taught the basics of man-to-man defense. Even my best players that travel all over and play AAU ball have no idea what a weak-side rotation looks like or how to guard a pick-n-roll outside of a switch.I hear kids say things like “your man put up 20 points on you” without understanding their role (or lack of a role) in rotating from the weak side to prevent easy layups. The term man-to-man is kind of misleading because kids think they’re only responsibility is the player they’re assigned to.Please teach your kids how to play man-to-man, even if it means losing a game or two or getting some push back from kids/parents that don’t know any better. It’ll be worth it in the long-run.",1

"I am 15 yrs and 7.5 months. I’m 5’9 and I have been attempting to dunk for around 6 months however I have not been training specifically for it at all. I can grab rim with both hands and dunk a tennis ball without any warmups. I cannot palm the ball however I do believe I have a decent arm length however I have not measured at all. I play football/soccer around 4 times a week, workout around twice a week, have a PE lesson each week and bike to school every weekday so I am pretty fit and have strong legs. I’m around 125lbs also. My 22 yr old brother is 5’11 and I have shown signs of being slightly taller possibly when fully grown so I was wondering if I’m close or will be able to dunk and if any could help?

I play 2k and all but it doesn't suffice. I utilize basketball for getting out my weekly anger and stagnant energy. Not being able to have friendly physical competition on the court has left a void in my life. I have been playing since I was 7. There are tons of places I can reallocate this energy, I know, but nothing is the same. I don't know what I'm trying to get out of writing this other than just being the Covid oped of how it hits some of us the hardest.

I don’t know if I should go to a lower division school where I know the coach and players or go to a high division school where I don’t know anyone . I’m trying to at least get recruited by a JUCO . Currently I’m a 6’0/6’1 shooting guard at 15.",1
"Whenever I'm about to shoot from anywhere on the court I feel like the momentum just gets sucked out from my feet. And I am aware of how I should be lifting my heels beforehand (I'm always lifting my heels before a shot). But I think that my running technique is the problem here. Whenever I'm running, should I put my weight on my heels or or the front of my foot for each stride? Because I'm one of those players like Paul George (not saying I'm anything near to his level) that really isn't the fastest in terms of pure speed and relies more on balance and footwork. Any advice would be truly appreciated. Thank you.",1

What is a good amount of shots you should take a day to keep a consistent jumper?,1
"The other day I was playing 1-on-1 with a friend who is of similar height, strength and speed.  Given that there's no shot clock, whichever one of us is on offense has been consistently able to get to the post via driving, then backing down the defender.  Once the offense is close enough (around the second hash mark in the paint), he initiates a series of back-to-the-basket post moves that usually ends in a hook shot or fadeaway jumper.On defense, neither of us have been able to block or affect the shot of the fadeaway / hook shot, so the point pretty much comes down to whether the shooter misses or not.Ideally as the defender, I would like to prevent the offense from getting so close to the basket, but it's very difficult because the offense can always make progress and back his way closer to the basket, but as the defender I can't really legally push him away from the basket.  Also, if I really try to apply a strong force, I risk the offense using my momentum against me to do a baseline spin for the easy layup.Anyone have any ideas how to check the fadeaway / hook shots? Or is this why professional NBA players have dribble limits when they play 1:1, because otherwise it would be too easy for the offense?",1

"Hey! I am a 20 year old woman, supposed to start uni in September but a rare genetic disease and COVID will cause me to only start attending physically in January. I am a HUGE NBA fan, I got into it kind of randomly in 2018 and I got completely hooked. I live in France and it's not really in our culture, so there aren't that many amateur basketball clubs to join, let alone ones that accomodate women. I'm dying to learn how to play basketball so that, once I get on campus I can join my uni's female basketball team. First of all, do you think I could realistically reach a good level by playing every day for four months, knowing I have never touched a ball before? (The team's website says they welcome amateurs too)Do you have any tips, notably in terms of technique? I'm quite quick on my feet but also quite scrawny and unathletic (my disease comes with anaemia, which can make me lightheaded super quickly, so I haven't really had the occasion to practise any sport in a while but I was always great at running/jumping. My doc says I can train lightly and will be back on my feet by January.) How do I go about all of this? Thanks in advance for your tips!",1

"I always played a bit of basketball when I was younger (for school teams and just general messing around). However I only recently got my own net for my back garden. Before I got it I decided that I would not bounce the ball in my back garden and would just focus on shooting, as I know the noise can be quite irritating. I have stayed true to this but every time I take a shot the bounce still sounds quite loud. I tried rebounding all my shots before the bounce but that obviously didn't work very well.There is also sometimes the problem of a stray bounce off the rim that goes towards my window. I was looking at returners but it seems the only affordable ones are the ones that collect made shots only. I was wondering if anyone knew of any affordable ones that collected missed shots? Would also be open to other suggestions to solve the noise problem. Thanks",1

"Recently I was playing basketball with some friends. I drove to the basket and was fouled while taking a layup, thus prompting me to call the foul in the middle of my shot. The layup proceeded to fall and I just assumed the bucket would count and I’d get the ball back (we were playing 2v2 winners ball). However, the opposing team was adamant that me calling foul (even before I made or missed the shot) negated the points scored. This made absolutely no sense to me because then are you supposed to just never call foul in hopes of making the basket and not negating it? Additionally it takes more skill and finesse to finish through a foul so the points are especially earned. In every other form of basketball you’re allowed to get a foul call and still try and finish the bucket if you’re in the shooting motion. Why is street ball different?",1

"Looking back at my basketball career as I'm going to college, the highest level I played was Varsity and even on that team I wasn't very good. So my biggest advice to young players is to play more. It may not be the smartest idea right now during quarantine so make sure you stay safe.Anyway, at my HS I was very introverted so didn't have a lot of friends that played b-ball but I loved it and practiced a lot by myself. Shooting drills, handling drills, analyzing pro games. I was trying everything to make myself improve BY MYSELF. And that was the greatest problem, there's only so much you can do by yourself.You need to play with friends which is both fun and good for your skill building as you try out new things and seeing what works and what doesn't. Watching pro games can only do so much, you need to actually put yourself in a game like situation to improve your speed of play.The only time I played with others was during team practices and games. The people on my team were constantly playing every weekend with friends.So this is my greatest advice. Play pickup or something. And most importantly, make sure you have fun. I'm gonna be honest, I hated practicing by myself because it was boring and exhausting and repetitive and frustrating. Not very fun. Playing with friends will be great.",1

"Ok so I know what you're thinking.""You're just now...in 2020...liking basketball....bruh."" So basically like when the NBA was coming back to resume the league, I was curious.  My main question as a fan of a lot of other sports was: ""hmmm...wonder how the pause in the season is going to effect how they do shit"" and WOW. seeing so many of teams top stars doing so well after a good rest was really cool to see and so I went from just enjoying playoff deciders to thinking...""maybe I should start rooting for a team"" 🤷‍♂️ (I also discovered Secret Base, previously known as SBNation on YouTube and fell in love with their content) To give some more context I was born and raised about an hour from Oakland/SF and obviously have noticed the YEARS of the GS Warriors doing incredibly well, even before I started actually watching full games this year I would peek in every now and then and watch the Warriors do some pretty incredible stuff, (as well as just be aware of other notable players on other teams) HOWEVER I DO NOT feel sincere rooting for them. To just go from not really enjoying the sport to just start rooting for the team that is coming off one of the most impressive teams in sports history and is arguably just going to go right back to its winning ways I can't consciously implode the bandwagon.To go back to what I was saying earlier I got into the sport definitively through the playoff deciders so yeah I was gonna technically be bandwagoning no matter who I ended up rooting for. BUT after carefully accessing how I was gonna pick the team I decided to do it the way I initially picked my favorite soccer team, I looked at who my favorite player was playing for...so for this it came down to 2 guys for me with my limited knowledge:Russell WestbrookAnd Jimmy Butler.The decider to that came down to the sole fact that I will not root for a texas team.So after binging secret base videos, doing some research on the organization as well as watching the team get a 2nd victory over the pacers in the playoffs, I became a Miami Heat Fan.

"Hi, I'm 23 and relatively new to basketball in the sense that I have not played in games much (only shooting around for fun). For a long time I've practiced shooting with one hand, where my hand comes out to my side (an L shape) kind of like a hook shot but I am facing the ring with my body. I did this originally as I could generate a lot of power as I am using my shoulder to catapult the ball into the air. The release feels really satisfying and smooth, and it is more accurate than when I shoot with two hands from any point on the court. My question is, someone has told me that it isn't good to shoot like that and I do not know what to do. How do I make something else feel comfortable? and how do I make sure to not learn the wrong thing?I want to get better at basketball as I really love it and its fun (even though I am not that good). I don't even know where to find a coach to try get better, and YouTube has so many different shooting methods that it confuses me. Sorry if this didn't make any sense.Thank you",1

I didn't do any test on my running speed. My question is, how much more can I improve? Its already been 4-5 months and I feel that I reached a peak last 2 months. I have been scaling my training from body weights to weighted exercises, progressively increasing. Also doing plyos appropriately. I realised that my diet / weight has been holding me back so I decided to get leaner dropping from 179 lbs/81 kg to 168 lbs/ 76 kg now.Also I do take recovery seriously stretching and foam rolling after my workouts and before bed.Do I just need to continue grinding it out or need to try something new.

I was always really good at scrimmaging and practicing, so I managed to make a circuit team. However, I would always over think in games and choke. After reading this book, I have finally understood how to truly play in game. Played a adidas gauntlet team yersterday and got my first double double. I know there much to improve on, but my performance has skyrocketed ever since reading the book. I highly recommend this book if you struggle with this problem like I do.

Dear dunkers,1
"Hi,I know next to nothing about basketball except for what I've seen in some NBA documentaries (not really into watching sports, but very into watching documentaries about sports). My boyfriend is a huge fan of a particular NBA player and I'd like to get him some sort of autographed memorabilia. But as a noob I have two questions:* What tends to make a better gift in this space? A signed jersey, or ball, or something else? Is it purely down to personal preference or does one type of item tend to be preferred (either for sentimental or value over time reasons)? Even with jerseys, I don't know what's best - the home or away colors (although I'm guessing home), or size (should I go for a size that matches my boyfriend, or the authentic size of the actual player if this is for collectible purposes? I doubt the boyfriend would actually be wearing such an item...) I also noticed that jerseys with stitched on numbers are considerably more expensive. Is it a matter of getting one of these stitched on jerseys or none at all, or would any jersey with an authentic signature make a good gift?And I also see different ball color schemes, some with team logos etc. Is a classic orange signed Spalding preferred vs one in team colors or with a team logo? Or does it not matter at all and I'm just overthinkng this? * Are there any basic guidelines or red flags on checking authenticity? I'm afraid to buy anything through ebay, but even on non ebay sites as I don't know much about this I'm worried about falling for a counterfeit. Is a JSA authenticity certificate enough to look for? What if the JSA certificate itself is fake? Any surefire way to know I'm picking up an authentic item?Thanks in advance for any advice!",1
How to get my shooting back?,1
"I (25/M/USA) want to start playing but I'm kind of garbage. Are there any recommended video guides or training camps I could look into? So far I've decided to just start shooting around at my gym. I used to play a lil in middle school but I was kinda garbage, didn't score all season. Not looking to get competitive, just wanna hoop around",1
"So today I went to this little court I go to practice basketball (just to stay fit, and because I love the sport) (for clarification: I've never played more than high school level and have never practiced in a team, with a proper coach, routines etc. I always played with friends though, and tried to get it right and improve, but nothing serious. I started playing again in my 40's because it seemed a good way to stay fit and exercise outdoors)So this dude comes around and starts shooting. I immediately see that he's very good. He starts nailing triple shots with perfect shooting form without any effort and I'm realizing the guy's a beast. So I go up and say hey, can I ask you for some advice?I didn't want to interfere with his routine or training, I was just looking for a quick tip.But the dude immediately drops everything and starts giving me a detailed explanation, asking me to follow his moves, do this, look at that. Correcting me, encouraging me, explaining again. Checking if I followed instructions. He even pulls out his phone and records me twice and shows me in slow motion what was I doing correctly and what I was doing wrong.With just a 3/4 tips, he has been able to change my shooting form completely, and now it feels so easy, so effective and effortless. I was able to balance the force used better, to focus on my aiming more, and my body just felt right throughout all the shooting move.Turned out he is a pro basketball player, he plays 2nd national division in my country and is here on vacation lol. He made my day. He was so supportive and nice, even when we chatted for a while afterwards.I probably thanked him 10 times, and still don't think it was enough. Soooo happy that this happened to me. Sometimes just asking for help goes a long way!",1

How do you warm your shot up fast/where do you aim?,1
How can I get more comfortable with handling the ball?,1
"So probably many of you know that at first, kids or teens start of by releasing the ball with two hands because that way you can get power on your shot to make it.  So me (14 years old) who started basketball 3 year ago, I got really good at playing it. I started with the normal two hand release to a decent release. Could hit mid-ranges anywhere I wanted, except long mid shots and 3 pointers. Now I don't even shoot deep mid shots and I still have to shoot 3pters with both of my hands. I am really accurate at shooting 3pters with two hands, but the problem is that if I continue doing this, it's going to be hard to continue shooting with one hand.  I have a couple reasons why I can't shoot deep with one hand:1. I'm too weak2. When I shoot, sometimes I get uncomfortable or my shooting hand gets tense when releasing. Leading to flat arc or airball3. When I start shooting, my shot pocket isn't over my head. Meaning when I am getting ready to shoot I most likely shoot flat or something else happens4. Need to fix my hand release (fingers), because some times when I release the ball I make the ball flat by awkwardly releasing the ball with my fingers or handThere's a couple reasons I can't shoot deep and miss shots.I want to find some way to fix my shot and also shoot deeper by fixing my release.  Oh, also, if any of you have any tips for my guide hand, then please tell me!Thank you for reading!",1
"I played basketball as a kid growing up but stopped in middle school as I had focused on other sports. However, I've been hoping to get back into it and I am realizing that despite being 6'6 I have virtually no vertical (can grab rim but that's it) and lack the power and explosiveness to really improve my game. Also, since the last time I played basketball I was like 12 years old and I never learned how to properly utilize my height. Some background: 20M, 6'6 and about 180 pounds which is pretty skinny. I consider myself ""in shape"" because I am a runner usually doing 45-90 minute runs at a decent pace, however this type of fitness is not helping me with my vertical or overall explosiveness. Most of my runs are aerobic but I occasionally do some faster paced anaerobic training.I have heard that losing weight is helpful for improving vertical but due to running I don't have much weight to lose in the first place. My current plan includes increasing my calorie intake so I am actually gaining weight, as well as bodyweight workouts like jump squats and box jumps. I'm also hoping to spent time reading and watching videos about big man and power forward roles, as well. I want to focus more on ""quick twitch"" muscle development because right now my exercise is ""slow"" muscle work and endurance training.Are there some other things I should focus on or think about as I begin trying to improve my game? Any general advice about getting back into basketball would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks!",1

"I've been watching basketball for years but never stopped to watch an entire game from the man himself (or any old/legendary game), and today I decided to do just that, a 55 point MJ one against the Knicks (Ewing was amazing too) and not only the game dynamic was different, it flowed a LOT better, as there were fewer pauses and fouls, there was more *game* in the game, and Michael's playing is out of this universeI'm amazed on how different (and in many ways, better) basketball was in general. Even the broadcast and image were a surprise, it had a certain glare, and the crowd, soundtrack, and the overall scheme was so surprising, it was a beauty to look at, visually, one of the prettiest things I've ever seen, it's stunning. 5 hours later, I'm watching a Rockets x Bucks game and I can't help but feel that ""it's great but not the same thing"" feel in the back of my head (the absence of a crowd doesn't help a bit). I know we have the second best ever with LeBron today, but it's like something was lost with time, it doesn't get as ""grand"" as this old Bulls X Knicks game felt to me.

The highest fence I jumped over was 110cm (43 inches), still with room to spare I think.Now, that would put Michael Jordan's vertical only slightly above mine, but that can't be right. What correct way should I measure my vertical?",1

"Can you theoretically stay on one foot for as long as you want in layups? the rule is you have to shoot or pass before you land your last step. Can I take my time before I shoot or pass as long as I don't land my other foot? if someone fly by and trying to block, can I stay on one foot then shoot or pass? Does layup have to be continuous motion?",1

"Creating space is a major key to becoming harder to guard on the court. The best players int he world can create space whether it's for a jumpshot, or a layup.So what's the best way to create space??Pick a shoulder &amp; attack your opponent hard &amp; make him BELIEVE you're going to the goal. Then abruptly stop on the dime OR if you need even more space slightly pushoff (do not extend your arm) to create space for your shot!You can do a sidestep, stepback, fadeway, whatever you need to get your shot off. The point remains the same. Attack &amp; React!",1

"Instead of the classic old ""shoot for it"" or ""ball don't lie"" rule, we adapted a rule where if there is an argument or controversy,  each team takes turns getting the ball. If team x got the ball first, upon the first argument, team y would get it. What do you all think about this rule. Should it be adapted at all courts. I always absolutely hated the shoot for it rule. The BALL DOES LIE. And the rule is heavily favored for people that are good at shooting 3s. Often I see this rule abused. A good three point shooter will just start an argument about a call, then he'll shoot for it and likely make it. It's a win-win situation.  It just doesn't make sense how this street rule got started.",1

"Hear me out on this, Dame Lillard and Trae Young have better range than Steph Curry, although Steph is still the superior shooter, as he will remain the greatest shooter the game has ever seen for a long time. However when it comes to range, Dame is the best from that distance of 30+ footers, with Trae being in second. Steph Curry has made 61 3s his career from 30 feet and beyond on 36 percent shooting. Dame in 74 games this season made 56 30 footers on 43 percent shooting. It’s safe to say if it was a full season Dame would’ve made more 30 footers in one season on a higher percentage. Dame has the most range. As for Trae, he made 9 out of 16 shots from 35 feet and beyond, Steph made 9 out of 111. Trae just finished his second season. Although Steph was the one who started shooting these shots, Dame and Trae took it to a whole new level.",1
"I'm planning on buying a basketball rim to drill it up on the wall of my house,  just for casual shooting and all that in my backyard.. I've read some articles online and they say that regulation rims are 18 inches big, I DON'T want that because it feels way too big, I don't know if it's just me but I could've swore I've been practicing and playing on way smaller rims.I'm deciding on either 14 or 16 inches big, at first I thought of 14 inches because my backyard doesn't go that far anyway and if it did, I would've picked the 18 inches and start practicing really deep shots, but unfortunately.. nope; and it's so I could take my mid-range game to the next level and start having tighter and more straighter shots so the next time I go outside, my shots are way more consistent.But then I thought, wait.. if regulations are 18 inches, then wouldn't 14 inches be too small and too difficult then?But the 16 inches look way too big for me too, it basically just feels like I'm cheating.I'm not necessarily only going to use this for actual training and to become better but as well as to keep my shots fixed by doing casual shooting, so I don't want to have a hard time getting the ball in. So my question comes, Should I buy a 14 inch rim, 16 inch rim, or just stick with the regulation with 18 inch?Thank You!",1

"I quit basketball 10 years ago due to various reasons. I starting playing again March and joined a recreational league last week. I am a pretty decent center 6'7 and my post moves are still pretty solid. However I cant dribble a ball to save my life. So I dont dribble, I pass, post moves get to the rim etc. I played in a recreational league before and I dont think I have ever shot a three in a serious match(I am a center but still)But for the love of god and this annoys me so much: why does everyone think shooting threes is efficient. I havent seen anyone who averages above 25% in shooting drills so why the fuck do you think it is a good idea to shoot threes. They are the most wasteful shot in basketball unless you are an elite level player.10 years ago seeing a three in recreational league was a rare thing, nowadays people just accept that guards can shoot threes if they  are open, it is so inefficient.",1

"Anthony Davis.Over-rated.Don’t get me wrong.Hear me out.Individually, he is great and his stats state that.Team wise, not so much. How the media has hyped him up to be this great player is too much to take.Yesterday against rockets, he had the chance to step up and deliver and earn the respect of his teammates and peers. But he failed to make an impact on the game. While Harden balled out. Both teams had MVPs resting so both teams were equally matched according to me. Also, playing back to back shouldn’t be a problem considering Davis is still young and he scored 9 against OKC, if that wasn’t embarrassing enough already. He should have kept them in the game at least. Back to back losses. Also, Lebron gives 4 to 5 assists a game to AD, so that’s like 8 to 12 points per game. He is very dependent on Lebron to lead and provide. He has had his good games in bubble. But not when mattered the most. Also, speaks of why new orleans never made it to playoffs most of the times. Comparing him to legends with multiple championships is disrespectful to the real legends of the game. And calling him arguably the best big to play by some critics is bogus. So, the credit is due and he is yet to earn his due. #Facts",1

How to practice with *extremely* limited space?,1
I’ve recently decided I will be starting a more in depth training programme in order to outwork the players around me and eventually be a more complete player. However I sprained my foot about a week ago and the pain is still there it has healed a little bit because I can now walk but increased speeds even jogging is still very painful. I was wondering what people thought about me continuing my training right now despite probably not being able to get in good reps on my shots etc. Should I wait for it to heal completely before returning to my training? And if so how long could this take.If so what could I do in the mean time in order to still work on my basketball for example increase my IQ by watching a few games a day etc. It would be really helpful if I got a few replies Thanks,1
I don’t know much about basketball. I can enjoy watching a few ballgames and really enjoyed the Raptors Final a year or two ago. The most I know about MJ is from Space Jam because I’ve seen it maybe 20 times. Why is he so good? I’ll take a long or abridged version. Thanks!,1

I am looking for a book that shows the essential moves, gives advices on exercises to improve, etc. I would particularly love player movements broken down in sequential images.I searched on the internet and found something that is close, it is titled basketball anatomy, the illustrations shows key muscle groups and stuff, but it is more focused on strength training for basketball players.

"Just had a quick question for people to answer on. I have been having a twitter war with this person for the past couple days with him saying Bam Adebayo is a better defender than Anthony Davis... For some reason everything I'm telling him isn't getting to him. I told him he's finished top 2-3 in DPOY race over 2 times now, a 2x 1st team all defense, 2x 2nd team all defense and he just keeps saying its a ""popularity contest"" and he's saying a 1x 2nd team all Defense Bam Adebayo is a better defender because ""he can guard the 1-5"" and keeps trying to call me a casual, ikr doesnt make sense. I feel like I am losing brain cells during this argument and losing knowledge about basketball, I know this guy is a casual though because he says Lebron should've won DPOY and is still a better defender than AD. This guy is hurting me from how bad his takes are. so I just wanted to ask if there's legitly anyone else who believes Bam is a better defender than AD, or if there is a legitimate argument between their defense, because to me, theres no comparison between the 2 players.

I played basketball as much as i could last year, and the efforts showed off as i made the team over 80 other people. But the season was what changed me. All my efforts were squandered, my defense was subpar and i was a mediocre rebounder. I thought that my offense would have greatly improved, but i was wrong. I scored 0 points the whole season.Not a single free throw or anything.The season changed me so much, i just couldnt. I felt like telling my coach that im gonna quit the team. That season just embarrased me so much and i cringe every time i think of it. I have worked with everything i can since then. But there is still a voice in my head telling me the same will happen next season, or that i wont even make the team at all. Its hurting me, really. How can i work on my game?

"Last month I attended a couple of basketball tournament, and I've found that I can't translate my skills in real games when playing against defenders on me. I am a guard and a very good ball handler that can pull up mid-range shots pretty well, but during the games I was frozen and my head went blank all the times against tough defenders and had to pass the ball to my teammate that can attack the rim. This has made me start doubting myself if I should not spend hours practice those drills alone and also made me start losing confidence recently because I feel like all those hours and grinds I've spent are not showing...The worst part is that I know my skills are better than many people out there but I am less useful when it comes to real games. This sucks.I practice alone a lot on daily basis after work, and I don't screw around just shoot for fun. I've been grinding my ass off. However, I rarely play real games with others. I know I should play more against people but most my teammates live far away and not many people play basketball in my hood...

"Quick information: I’m 15. I play with around 7 other people that are all my family friends. All of our parents come from a region in india where the average males is around 5’4 to 5’6.

When I go for the post my arms get grabbed onto and I have to really struggle to get the rebound or put back and when I go for my the mid range or past the 3 pt line my arms are completely sore and or my lack of dribbling skills make it really hard to be a knock down shooter. I’m also a decent passer but my teammates are often not and throw passes that are super low and or slow and really don’t realize I’m well over 1/2 a foot taller than everyone else so they can just chuck the ball up to my arms. Fouls are never called, I get pushed, my arms are grappled, and I always get bad teammates. Does anyone have any like exercises, drills, or strats to help me last longer in games and punish defenders in all places?Thanks...",1
"So I (27) never played in any organized basketball. No middle school no high school no college. I’ve only ever played pick up. I never took it serious until this year with everything getting shut down I figured it was the perfect time to get my skills up. My shot has drastically improved. I was always the guy pulling up from 3 with terrible form. I seem to have found my range (post &amp; mid range mostly)  &amp; when I’m in a groove can extend to the 3. However obviously I’m not Steph Curry and sometimes I just can’t buy a bucket. Because of my history of being a terrible shooter, whenever my shots aren’t falling, I lose confidence &amp; it’s essentially game over on the offensive side for me. And if my shots aren’t dropping the defense sags off &amp; clogs any open lanes. When I’m in a rhythm I have no difficulty slashing or cutting, but I can’t seem to get aggressive &amp; go to the bucket if my J’s don’t fall. How do I get over this hump? I still have to keep working on my game &amp; improve my shooting &amp; I work on it. But I just can’t seem to get over this issue. I’m definitely not a ball hog but I want to be efficient &amp; not hurt my team with bricks or nervously attacking then getting the ball ripped. I know confidence comes from putting in the work. So should I just keep working &amp; eventually things will open up? Or are there any tricks to help? Any exercises to aid? My passing is above average I’d say as well so players closing out on slashes gets me to give up the ball. Should I just attack &amp; dish out if they collapse when my shot isn’t falling? I’m trying to find the best way to be efficient &amp; help the team so any tips are appreciated.",1

I played against one and I am only 5’11 and an 5’4 WNBA player stepped onto the court at a basketball camp in Brooklyn. We played and she barely lost. She was lighting fast, pulled from the logo and drained it easily. She was strong as hell and used her shoulders too push me back from the rim. She was strong so if I tried to back her down she would push me back. She drives the rim? Her strength would just push me off her. I only won because I hit a few lucky threes. WNBA players are like D3 or D2 college ballers, just less athletic. If she was taller, I would have lost",1

Realistic Vertical jump potential help,1
"So a month ago in a pickup game, i felt a twist in my knee. I went to see a local doctor and with the medicine he has given , my knee has recovered to full range of motion. I can walk, jump and even crouch. But at random times, when i bend my knee, i feel a blockage or tightness on the left of the knee cap. Not the side of the leg. It randomly happens and randomly goes away. Apart from that my knee works like a normal one.  I took xray and it doesnt show any broken bone. But i didnt get a chance to take mri. So i am wandering if its the meniscus, acl or the cartilage. I am looking forward to playing again but worried it would happen mid game. It has already been a month so i am kinda worried",1

Given the unpredictability of it where you will end up after going 360 degrees, maybe your a little too rotated or under rotated, it would require more mental effort and trick your brain into getting better at high pressure shots.

"**Preview:**The *Bianconeri* and *Giallorossi* battle it out in the Serie A big-match of the second Match-day.Juventus won their last match against Sampdoria with a dominant 3-0, demonstrating that years pass by, coaches changes but the *Old Lady* is always up there as one of the (if not the) strongest team in Italy. The biggest question mark this season, Pirlo's experience(or lack thereof), was blasted away by the treat to the eyes that was Juventus' performance last week.Roma come from a disappointing 0-0 against Hellas Verona. The *Giallorossi* suffered the lack of their best striker, who had to be left out because of Market reasons, however Dzeko's situation has been solved, with *The Swan of Sarajevo* who now is almost sure of staying in Rome for at least one more season.**Predicted line-ups**&amp;#x200B;||||*Roma*|||||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|||||Mirante||||||||||||||Mancini||Ibanez||Kumbulla|||||||||||Santon||Pellegrini||Veretout||Spinazzola||||||||||||Pedro||Mkhitaryan|||||||||||||||Dzeko||||&amp;#x200B;||||*Juventus*|||||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|||||Szczesny||||||||||||||Danilo||Bonucci||Chiellini|||||||||||Cuadrado||McKennie||Rabiot||Frabotta|||||||||||||Ramsey|||||||||||||||Kulusevski||C.Ronaldo|||**KEY-PLAYERS**It's far too easy to name CR7, 31 goals, and 6 assists in the previous Serie A, the Portuguese remains a beast even at 35.On the other side of the pitch, Edin Dzeko surely is the first name that comes to mind. 16 goals and 11 assists for the Bozniak in his last Serie A season he will look forward starting this one with a bang.Besides the 2 strikers, it will be interesting to see how Pellegrini will behave in the center-mid position. Last year the Roman was one of Roma's main players in the first part of the season, but slowly faded away in his performances after winter.On the opposite side we might want to keep an eye on McKennie, his transfer went almost unnoticed, yet the young American is once again in the starting eleven for Juventus, after his terrific game against Sampdoria.Another key player for Roma will be Kumbulla, from his performance will probably depend on the way the match will unfold. The young defender has been on the radar of almost all of the big clubs in Italy, but even with his talent, it may prove difficult to adapt to the way the team plays in only 10 days.For Juve, a similar case can be made for Danilo who, while being an experienced player, has spent most of his career as a full-back rather than a CB. Against Sampdoria, his new position didn't end up beeìing too much of an issue, who knows whether it will be the same against Roma.",0

"Julen Lopetegui started coaching after a steady career as a goalkeeper. He finished his career at Rayo Vallecano. He became the assistant for Spain´s U17 and in the same year; he was also a caretaker for Rayo Vallecano. This all took place in 2003. He wouldn’t coach actively before 2008, where he took over Real Madrid’s B side. His work at Real Madrid became the start of his illustrious coaching career. After one year at Real Madrid B, he would leave Madrid and take over Spain’s U19. It was here he demonstrated the incredible 4-3-3 formation, which would be his main formation. Spain was dominating national team football at the time, and Lopetegui was a part of the Spanish domination by winning UEFA European under-19 Championship in 2012 and UEFA European Under-21 Championship in 2013. He was coaching Spain´s U19 from 2010 to 2013, and he also coached Spain U21 from 2012 to 2014. His testimony with the youth teams was unbelievable with the record of 26-5-1.&amp;#x200B;[📷Lopetegui and Thiago after winning the EC for U21. Thiago was also awarded the best player award.]https://preview.redd.it/p5vrmoqy8vp51.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8a84b0096185da186b76560f60218ad5deb640",0

"When Saint-Étienne-Rennes becomes the most anticipated match of the week, you know things have gotten a bit weird. Still, after three wins and a draw for each, there's nothing to say about the fact that those are the teams that have performed the best in the league so far and they fully deserve their position as coleaders.---# Appetizers* In a match that won't stay long in people's memory, Lille logically beat Nantes 2-0 at home, with the first goal from Burak Yilmaz and an own goal from Nicolas Pallois. The nordists are still one of the two teams unbeaten in the league and while they're not as well oiled offensively as last year, they are extremely consistent, an asset that not a lot of teams own.* The big match. The event the world turned on the TV to watch. Saint-Étienne-Rennes. Well, that was a beating. Les Verts suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the bretons. Guirassy scored his third goal since his arrival, Aguerd proved again how good a recruit he was and Hunou, Rennes' very own Solksjaer, closed the debate for good. Saint-Étienne was dominated the whole match. Obviously the Fofana situation didn't help but it can't be the only explanation. Rennes is just the better team.* Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, Metz concedes a late goal. For the third time this season in only five games, Metz lost precious points in the last five minutes. After a loss in Lille at the 88th minute, another in Paris at the 93rd, this time it was Marseille that equalized at the 95th with Morgan Sanson finishing a brilliant sequence. Those late goals represent already four points and for a team that will fight to avoid relegation it's already quite a lot. Marseille on the other hand continues to play like those are summer friendlies but gets rewarded somehow. Still, it's the third match without a win for the phoceans.* After taking no points in four matches, Dijon was that close from getting three at once against the ever struggling away from home Montpellier. Unfortunately, a foul from Panzo on Delort (who scored earlier on a great cross from Laborde) on the last minute allowed Téji Savanier to equalize.* Monaco continues their tradition of getting red cards left and right (2 in this match, 13 since the start of the last season). Fortunately, they have become competent at football again. Besides the loss against Rennes last week, Monaco have't conceded any defeat this season, winning 3 and drawing once while dominating their opponents most of the time. Ben Yedder scored twice, Aguilar being the other scorer for Monaco. Strasbourg relied on Chahiri and a penalty from Ajorque to keep the pressure on the men from le Rocher. That wasn't enough.* Lyon didn't manage to beat Lorient despite having the ball 70% of the time. At one point it was even looking like they would not get any point at all after Hamel got himself strangely alone then sent the ball to Wissa who put it right under the bar. But ten minutes later, the french international Léo Dubois equalized on a Robben-like goal perfectly executed. That won't satisfy anyone in the club as Lyon concedes their 4th match in a row without a win, just like Lorient by the way, but obviously the ambition from both clubs are slightly different.* Getting to face PSG during a period of doubt is not the greatest gift you could ask. After being eliminated in Europa League qualifiers at the hands of the juggernaut MOL Fehérvar, Reims hosted the european vice-champion on sunday night and while they held their ground as they usually do against Paris, the talent on the other side was too much to contain. Mauro Icardi finally awakened and scored a brace after seven months without a goal. Granted Paris didn't play four months but still, it was getting seriously worrying. The score could have been far greater if not for a top performance from Rajkovic. Business as usual.---# Main Course### []",0

"On 16th December 1899, Nottingham-born footballer Herbert Kiplin founded Italian giants AC Milan. “We will be a team of devils”, he said. “Our colors will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents”. Over the past few years now, AC Milan has been a shadow of its former self, having won the Serie A way back in 2011. It’s been 9 years now and the Rossoneri is still struggling to compete with Europe’s finest. At the forefront to change the fortunes of the fallen Italian giant is another giant - American investment management firm Elliott Management. Founded in 1977 by Paul Singer after borrowing $1.3 million from friends and family, the Elliott Corporation is now worth $35 billion.Elliott Management has a kind of cult status in the investing world, with some calling it “the vulture fund”, and for good reason. A vulture fund is an investment fund that seeks out and buys securities in distressed investments, such as high-yield bonds in or near default, or equities that are in or near bankruptcy. This is exactly the kind of situation in which Paul Singer and Elliott Management swooped in to take-over the Milan-based club. In April 2017, Chinese businessman Li Yonghong acquired AC Milan for €740m from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s investment firm Fininvest, ending his two-decade-long tenure at the club. This acquisition was completed by Yonghong via Rossoneri Sports Investment Luxembourg, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created to acquire the Italian giants.  Yonghong had big hopes for the club. Part of his strategy was to leverage the club’s massive Chinese fan base and reshape the financial and organizational structure of the club. To execute his vision, Yonghong borrowed loans worth almost €300m from Elliott Management with an interest rate of ~11%. A little over a year later in July 2018, Yonghong could not repay his debts losing around €500m in equity, effectively ending his brief stint at the club. Elliott swooped in, acquiring 99.93% of the stakes of AC Milan for €400m, half of what it was valued at just a few months earlier. **Project Milan 2.0**Elliott had a clear strategy for the club - raise the value of the club by winning matches on the pitch, make revenue off it, and sell for a healthy return. Over the past decade, the club’s annual revenues have hovered around the €200m mark. For perspective, Juventus’ annual return for the 2018-19 season was €494m. This is €94m more than what Elliott bought the entire club for. To solve this problem, the hedge fund first injected a sum of €50m into AC Milan to shore up the club’s balance sheets.Elliott also appointed former Arsenal Chief Executive Ivan Gazidis as AC Milan’s new Chief Executive. It also brought in two more important people to the club. Club legend Paolo Maldini was brought in as Technical Director and Italian businessman Paolo Scaroni was brought in as Chairman. To scout players, former Arsenal executive, and LSE alumni Henrik Almstadt was tasked with identifying transfers. So was former AS Monaco head scout Geoffrey Moncada. Another company that played a part in the Milan takeover by Elliott Management is the private investment group, Blue Skye. Founded by Napoli-based businessmen Salvatore Cerchione and Gianluca D'Avanzo, the two are board members at the Rossoneri, with D’Avanzo the Chief Financial Officer of the club. Both founders have had a long-standing relationship with former AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. All three of them were on the board of SOPAF - a private equity firm that owned 50% of Blue Skye until 2006. They later sold these shares to another hedge fund DB Zwirn. On March 20, 2017, Blue Skye played its first part in the Li Hongyong takeover when it took control of the Luxembourg Investment Company - the entity that lent the money to Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux, Hongyong’s SPV. On April 4, 2017, the Luxembourg Investment Company changed its name to Project Redblack. On April 10, 2017, Blue Skye ceded control of Project Redblack to two SPVs owned by Elliott management, King George and Genio, in Delaware. Once Elliott gained control of AC Milan, Blue Skye was given a small piece of the AC Milan pie. **What now for Milan**For the 2018-19 season, the first under Elliott management, AC Milan suffered the worst result in the club’s history with its loss before tax amount increasing from €121m to €143m.Unsurprisingly, this was also the worst in Serie A by some margin. For perspective, Inter had a total pre-loss amount of €40m and champions Juventus with €27m. The highest profit margin was reported by Atalanta who made €35m while also qualifying for the Champions League. One of the reasons for Milan’s poor numbers is the steep decline in profit on player sales - with the number falling a whopping €23m from €35m to €12m. For perspective, Juventus generated profits worth almost 10x more with €127m. In general, Milan has struggled with earning profits on player sales earning an average of €11m profit a year since 2014. In the same time period, Juventus have made a profit of €417m, Roma €391m, and Inter €185m. Despite Milan’s revenue rising 4% from €220m to €228m, it’s still less than half of Juventus who reported revenues worth €494m and €150m less than Inter’s €370m. They are ahead of Napoli though, who reported revenues worth €207m. However, things might be turning around for AC Milan. For instance, in the season recently completed (2019-20), Milan reduced their losses from €143m to €100m. Of these losses, €20m is directly attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Unlike other clubs in Serie A, the Rossoneri have no debt on the bond markets or from banks. For comparison, Juventus, Inter, and AS Roma have taken credits or issued bonds worth over €300m. This means that Milan is not answerable to any external investors or institutions. Its assets can also be easily liquidated as 100% of its shares can be sold for cash. Add to that its zero-debt, and Milan certainly appears a promising prospect for investors and sponsors. Plus the Zlatan effect isn’t too bad either. Could the Elliott formula be working?PS: If you're reading this far, please consider subscribing to [Weekend Beer]",0

"During the latest season break both André Schürrle and Benedikt Höwedes announced their retirement from football having both achieved the ultimate prize with their country back in 2014. Since that incredible victory in Brazil, the team has experienced a quite drastic change in fortunes and personnel, despite manager Joachim Löw still overseeing the German side. Some of the 23-man squad remain at the top level, with the stars of others fading; here then, is where the victorious 2014 Germany World Cup squad are now…**#1 – Manuel Neuer – Goalkeeper – Bayern Munich** Winning the Golden Glove in 2014, Manuel Neuer was undeniably the best goalkeeper in the world back in 2014 and his name was even in the hat for the Ballon d'Or, coming 3rd with a healthy 15% of the votes, especially considering the freakish talent he was up against with Messi and Ronaldo (who won it) ahead of him.Nowadays he captains the side to regular Bundesliga titles and is still as quick-reflexed as ever, sensing danger from with predator-like precision and bailing out rare errors from his back line. Injury problems seem to be behind him too, and he’s still holding down the number 1 jersey for the national side. He’ll undoubted have his eye on a 9th Bundesliga trophy and a 3rd Champion’s League winner’s medal in the next 12 months, being the serial winner he is.**#2 – Kevin Großkreutz – Defender – Free Agent** A lifelong Borussia Dortmund fan-become-legend, nobody on this list’s star has fallen quite like that of Großkreutz.Having left the side he adored in 2015, things went downhill faster than a Sadio Mane hattrick; some factors out of his hands, but other issues were firmly of his own ridiculous doing.  First came the paperwork issue as the big bossmen at Galatasary failed to submit the relevant documents in time, meaning the defender was ineligible to feature until January 1st. FIFA rejected any appeal and Großkreutz collected his paycheck before returning to Germany on January 6th without a single showing for the Turkish club. It was Stuttgart who bought him back home and the player looked happy to be back on the field, but the club were unable to retain their Bundesliga status, finishing 17th and being relegated for the first time in 41 years. The worst was yet to come though…Four days after being in a bar fight which saw he and a 16-year old be taken to hospital and a further four suspects arrested, the club terminated Kevin’s contract by mutual consent. “I made a mistake and for that I’m very sorry. I accept the consequences and regret that my time at Stuttgart has come to an end in this way,” said Großkreutz before adding “I don’t want anything to do with football for the time being.”One month later, he signed for Darmstadt 98. Make of that what you will. Recently e was kicked out of Uerdingen and has now sued the club over outstanding salary payments. Additionally he has resigned as manager of Landesliga (6th tier) club Türkspor Dortmund which he coached for a year. The man lives for the drama.**#3 – Matthias Ginter – Defender – Borussia Mönchengladbach**The youngest player on this list, Matthias Ginter was just 20 when he was selected for the World Cup squad following an impressive season with Freiburg.After the World Cup he signed for Borussia Dortmund before switching to his current club, Mönchengladbach, in 2017 where he has performed to a very strong level, helping the side return to the Champion’s League last season, a feat the side will be looking to repeat in the 20-21 campaign.**#4 – Benedikt Höwedes – Defender – Retired**Here he is then, the first of the retirees and a bonafide Schalke legend. Höwedes somewhat surprisingly featured in every single minute of the 2014 triumph, along with Neuer and captain Philipp Lahm – he was exceptionally reliable and versatile, slotting into the left back role with ease and providing the solid performances expected of him throughout. He almost opened the scoring in the final too, his header cannoning off the post late in the first half, placing him centimeters from immortality.  Having racked up 240 professional games for Schalke, a vast number of which as captain, he departed on loan to Juventus in 2017. Sadly, the injuries had caught up with him incredibly quickly, resulting in Höwedes only being able to feature in 3 games for the Italian champions.A move to Lokomotiv Moscow followed, ending his 17-year affiliation with Schalke. After two seasons in Russia, the club and player agreed to terminate his contract by mutual consent due to family reasons with his retirement arriving less than two months later, on July 31st of this year. **#5 – Mats Hummels – Defender – Borussia Dortmund**Another sure-fire legend of the professional game; Mats Hummels has been a leader at the heart of every defensive line he’s featured within. Scoring a couple of goals at the tournament, including the vital winner against France in the quarters, Hummels was a shining light of this German era.A Bayern youth player, Mats made the unholy switch back to the champions in 2016 following over 200 games for BVB. There, he would win three league titles, adding to his two previous collected with Dortmund, before making the £30 million return to the yellow and black, where he remains today, having had a wonderful season back towards the peak of his elegant defensive powers. Most noteworthy however, is that he was one of three veteran players (alongside Jérôme Boateng and Thomas Müller) who Löw would no longer be considering for selection as of 2019. Many have questioned this decision, especially given Germany’s less-than-consistent performances over the past couple of years, but the finger sniffer has held firm, and Hummels hasn’t featured in the national side since 2018.**#6 – Sami Khedira – Midfielder – Juventus**The ticking midfield maestro at the heart of the 2014 midfield, Khedira had another exceptional tournament to follow on from his 2010 success which saw him move to Real Madrid, where he won everything Spanish football has to offer. As his contract expired with Madrid, he was picked up by Juventus, in typical free transfer fashion. A consistent performer in Italy, introducing others into play delightfully, he’s managed a tidy amount of goals over his five-year Italian tenure too.Injuries have really started to ramp up however, and his legs are getting heavier on the field, so it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him depart The Old Lady come the end of his contract in summer.**#7 – Bastian Schweinsteiger – Midfielder – Retired**Rightly hailed by Joachim Löw as one of the greatest footballers Germany has ever produced, Bastian Schweinsteiger enjoyed an illustrious career at Bayern Munich, racking up 500 games across all competitions and playing a variety of important roles through the years.For many, he was man of the match in the 2014 final. Man-marking Messi out of the game for massive periods, controlling the midfield and launching attacks from deep – without him, the result could have been very different. Truly his finest hour.Post World Cup injury issues became ever clearer (this is becoming a bit of a theme, isn’t it), and with his career in Germany winding down, a switch to Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United army ensued. Sadly though, he struggled to pick up the pace the side demanded, and it never really felt like he achieved what was hoped of him at Old Trafford. Mourinho’s arrival spelt the end for the German, being harshly treated and effectively pushed out of the squad and placed on the unwanted list.As a result, he moved to Chicago Fire in the MLS and performed really well, seemingly having a new lease of life as he looked to guide the club to World Cup victory, if some journalists are to be believed…Retirement in 2019 followed and he now works as a pundit, casting his footballing brain across the airwaves.**#8 – Mesut Özil – Midfielder – Arsenal**During the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and for every season in between, Mesut Özil was one of the finest players on the planet; a serial assister who glided across the pitch with craftsmenship and fluidity like no other, he was the heartbeat of the attack for Germany, Real Madrid and Arsenal.Having experienced massive success at Werder Bremen and Real Madrid, his move to Arsenal in 2013 was met with glee, as another giant of the game was set to make a splash in the Premier League – and splash he did. It’s easy to forget due to Arsenal’s turgid recent years, that for many years Özil way THE man for Arsenal. Nowadays, he’s sometimes not even bench warming, and instead is smashing Fortnite whilst collecting his £350,000 per week and failing to make any sort of impact within the plans of Arteta and Unai Emery before him.The real controversy lies in his retirement from the national team though. After being pictured with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (along with İlkay Gündoğan) fans were outraged, as the image was seen as an endorsement of the president’s highly controversial policies. The DFB publicly distance themselves from the situation, but following a frankly horrendous 2018 World Cup campaign, the issue reared its head again.Özil addressed the concerns, stating that they solely discussed football, not politics, and that he was simply respecting the office of his family’s nation. He even battled back by zoning in on a potential lack of criticism received by Lothar Matthäus, who had met with Russian president Vladimir Putin before going on to accuse Reinhard Grindel, the DFB president, of racism. He promptly stepped down from the nation side in protest of his treatment, sparking yet more criticism in the direction of the Arsenal attacking midfielder. Nothing has changed since, but there was that occasion in 2019 when Erdoğan was best man at Özil’s wedding. I’m sure they only spoke about football though…**#9 – André Schürrle – Forward – Retired**The man who assisted that famous winning goal, André Schürrle, has experienced a turbulent career following the World Cup win. Leaving Chelsea in 2015 having never cemented his place in the starting line-up, he moved to Wolfsburg for approximately £22 million, performing to a high level in the green shirt and pushing him back towards the very top of his game. The result, a move to Borussia Dortmund for another sizeable fee but again his career took a nosedive. Injuries struck, and alongside it, poor performances.A loan move to Fulham showed promise, including a banging goal against Burnley, but he wasn’t the player Premier League had witnessed 4 years prior as Fulham dropped down to the Championship at the first time of asking. Another loan to Spartak Moscow failed to spark an upturn in form and retirement followed at just 29 years of age, with Schürrle stating that he no longer wanted to face the loneliness and endless competition of top-tier football.A beauty to watch on his day, it’s a real shame he never quite acheievd what was anticipated of him. At least we’ll always have that assist, and that performance against Brazil in the infamous 7-1, everyone else had downed tools, but Schürrle, brilliantly, was having none of that.**#10 – Lukas Podolski – Forward – Antalyaspor** Despite playing a bit-part in this crowning moment for his country, Lukas Podolski will live long in the memory of German fans, with wonderful World Cup campaigns in both 2006 and 2010 and a team of the tournament appearance at Euro 2008.The King of Köln, possessing unreal speed a foot like a traction engine, often saved his very best for the German national side, and is a cult hero for many across the globe.Having played in Germany, England, Italy and Japan and now Turkey with Antalyaspor, the man is best known for his dual spells at FC Köln where he racked up a mightily impressive 79 league goals, using his explosive pace to maximum effect in the Bundesliga.Nowadays, when he’s not appearing in the Turkish Süper Lig, he putting his well-earned cash to a good cause, having founded the Lukas Podolski Foundation for Sport and Education which aims to give prospects to disadvantaged children and young people, fight child poverty, and promote social inclusion and integration and understanding among nations.**#11 – Miroslav Klose – Forward – Retired**I simply cannot do this man justice in words. The all-time leading goal scorer in World Cup history, having converted in the famous 7-1 demolition of Brazil (surpassing Ronaldo Nazário’s as he went), Klose retired from the national side following his greatest triumph. Whilst well-regarded as a scoring machine for both club and country, he is often boxed in as simply an aerial threat when in reality, he is far more than that. Possessing a rapid change of pace, strong build-up abilities and ultimately, some of the finest movement you’re ever likely to see, Klose was a complete striker. Plus, he could even pull off a somersault celebration, and what’s not to love about that.Spending almost his entire club career in Germany, he eventually retired at Lazio with, as expected, a solid scoring record.Having been part of the national side’s coaching set-up, he is now second-in-command to the incredible Hansi Flick at Bayern, where his tactical nous is certain to help him to flourish into a blooming boss in future.  **#12 – Ron-Robert Zieler – Goalkeeper – FC Köln**Imagine making your professional debut with Northampton Town and ending up in a World Cup winning squad. That’d be bloody mint.A Manchester United youth prospect, Zieler carved out a fantastic career for himself. The goalkeeper made over 200 appearances across two spells for Hannover and had a strong season with Stuttgart before a second tricky term, when he scored a calamitous own goal against Bremen. Caught out pulling his socks up when a throw-in came his way, he miscontrolled the ball and was forced to dive in vain as the ball trickled into the net. If that isn’t legacy, I don’t know what is.Now he sits happily on the bench for FC Köln, but if Timo Horn continues his current form, he could find himself between the sticks once more. **#13 – Thomas Müller – Forward – Bayern Munich**The Bundesliga champion, assist master, space-invader, world cup top scorer, Germany centurion. What can be said about Müller that hasn’t been already. He’s perennially underrated, being one of the finest and most consistent players of a generation. Aged just 24 when the 2014 contest rolled around, he had already accumulated 49 international appearances, and followed on from his destruction of England and Argentina in 2010 with another 5 goals at the finals, pairing a silver boot with his previous gold in South Africa.The man has hardly missed a beat since, with his only real blip coinciding with the turbulent tenure of Niko Kovač. Now at 30 years of age, he’s leading Bayern to yet more league glory, with this year’s Champion’s League being a cherry atop his sporting cake. As mentioned earlier however, Müller has been frozen out of the Germany squad by Joachim Löw, seemingly one of the scapegoats of the group stage exit in Russia. He stated that he was “angry and surprised” by the dropping of himself and his fellow teammates and given his incredible form (particularly this past season) it is more than understandable as to why.**#14 – Julian Draxler – Midfielder – Paris Saint-Germain**Destined for great things was young Julian. You’d have found him floating around the top of many a top prospect lists around the time of the tournament in Brazil; and whilst he’s had a more than respectable career in many a sense, he hasn’t truly hit the heights expected of him during those early Schalke days.After moving onto Wolsburg for a hefty sum, it felt like Draxler was set to kick his career into the upper gears, helping the club reach the Champion’s League quarter finals for the first time ever. However, the club felt he had not met up to the lofty expectations and Draxler duly wished to move on. Offers arrived but it would take until Christmas Eve later that year when PSG would stump up €42 million to secure his services, ending what the midfielders described as “the worst first half of a season of my career.”He only made 20 appearances across all competitions for the French capital club in the previous term, without registering a single goal. Maybe the farmers have too much for him and again, it may be time to move on.**#15 – Erik Durm – Defender – Eintracht Frankfurt**When I heard Huddersfield Town were signing former World Cup winning defender you better believe my fantasy football senses were tingling off the charts.The tingling was short lived. Huddersfield finished bottom and Durm was an absolute shadow of the player many Yorkshire fans had expected. But enough about the bad part, let’s hear some good.With BVB he had some good times, racking up a tidy half century of appearances in the yellow and black, and now he’s back in the Bundesliga with Frankfurt where he hopes to reignite his career on home soil.**#16 – Philipp Lahm – Defender – Retired** Captaining a side as gargantuan as this is no easy task, and there aren’t too many captains that measure up to the golden goose that is Philipp Lahm. Lahm was the ultimate in high-level versatility, playing in the back line and midfield, with technical ability and tackling acumen on either foot – he’s also one of the most tactically intelligent players I’ve ever had the joy of watching, always appearing in the correct position and barely breaking stride to disrupt opposition moves. At the World Cup he was imperious, starring in multiple positions and staking his claim as one of the best players at the tournament. Watching him lift the trophy (a first for unified Germany) was a joy to be hold and the highlight of a career that included a multitude of awards.Should he move into management, I have no doubt he would be a success, given his second-to-none understanding of the game. Plus, he’s a wonderful man, helping to support a number of charities and advocating for tolerance of homosexuality in football.**#17 – Per Mertesacker – Defender – Retired**Back in the day Per Mertesacker was one of the most effective centre backs in Europe. At Hannover and Werder Bremen he established himself as a sensible centre back with an exceptional understanding of the game and disciplinary record. Obviously dominant in the air (being a whopping 6 foot 7) it is often forgotten how cool the man was with the ball at his feet – sure, he has a lack of pace, but was rarely caught out in the Bundesliga or internationally.At the German World Cup in 2006, the 2008 Euros and the 2010 World Cup Mertesacker was a regular feature, showing a strong partnership with Christian Metzelder at the heart of defence. The emergence of Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber and Jérôme Boateng ultimately played into the stepping back of Mertesacker, but he’ll be fondly remembered at international level.At Arsenal, he was a great leader and player, but injuries derailed his later years. His performance in the 2017 FA Cup final will live long in the memory – having not started all season, he rolled back the years and put in a titanic performance, leading Arsenal to yet another FA Cup triumph. He’s still at Arsenal now, as he manages the academy and continues to showcase his professionalism and desire to the next generation. **#18 – Toni Kroos – Midfielder – Real Madrid**You obviously don’t win the World Cup nowadays without a premium squad, but the stacked level of this squad this squad is just absurd.   At the time of the tournament Kroos was still a Bayern player, moving to Madrid shortly after and continuing his meteoric to the top of the midfield tree. His incredible performance in that 7-1 demolition was a huge statement on the biggest stage, yet he still somehow moved for just under £30 million. One of the transfers of the millennium without a doubt.He’s been a constant at the spine of the side since, forming a fruitful relationship with both Casemiro and Modric, helping to capture La Decima, the first of a hattrick of Champion’s League trophies for Toni in white.And he’s still doing it to this day, dictating tempo, snaffling attacks and scoring the occasional banger (see Germany v Sweden at the Russia World Cup), simply put, he can do it all and we’re incredibly lucky to be able to witness a player of his calibre week in, week out.**#19 – Mario Götze – Midfielder – Free Agent**From a talent fully realised, to one who was destined for so much more.After coming off the bench in the final and quite brilliantly squeezing home the winning extra time goal Götze had punched a one-way ticket to mega stardom, individual awards and championship glory throughout his career. And whilst much of this success reigns true, the train much have gotten a little lost en route to the destination. A mixture of less-than-incredible form and ultimately, a metabolic disorder which causes the fibres of the muscles to not function correct, meant young Mario pulled into the station a few stops short of the all-time greats. Now he’s a free agent, and the versatile forward could be of some use to a number of Bundesliga sides, depending on who can afford his wage demands. Who knows what the future will hold for the 28 year old, but I’m sure everyone hopes he’ll be able to somehow rediscover that electric form that put him on the roadmap in the first place. **#20 – Jérôme Boateng – Defender – Bayern Munich**The younger brother of Ghana’s Kevin Prince-Boateng, Jérôme backed his abilities when leaving Manchester City in search of more playing time in central defence, rather the being farmed out at right back. People weren’t sure he was good enough, but not only did he talk the talk, he walked the walk, ran the run and showed everyone in England exactly what they had been missing, becoming one of the most decorated defenders the game has ever seen along the way.Sure, there have been some downs (mainly Kovač dropping him and Messi imploding his ankles with the force of one thousand suns) but its been a career in Germany full of ups, including last season. With David Alaba moving to centre back, Boateng was imperious, cleaning up attacks and helping build from the base of Bayern’s traditional 4-2-3-1, helping the side add yet another European trophy to their illustrious cabinet. This year will be more of a challenge than the last given Flick’s pancake-thin squad, but Boateng will likely shine once again before inevitably moving to Manchester United as his decline hits.**#21 – Shkodran Mustafi – Defender – Arsenal**Everton &gt; Sampdoria &gt; Valencia &gt; Arsenal – Shkodran Mustafi has had quite the memorable career path thus far. Eligible to represent Germany, North Macedonia and Albania, Mustafi made the right choice in opting to appear for his birth nation, appearing as a substitute throughout the 2014 tournament, and getting his hands on sport’s greatest prize.Following the tournament, he moved to Spain and was one of the standout centre backs in La Liga, hence why Arsenal came sniffing for his signature. Surprising as it may be, he hasn’t always been the meme player he is now and he’s definitely shown a return to form under Arteta, whether he’s the standard they require anymore remains to be see, but this season will likely tell all.**#22 – Roman Weidenfeller – Goalkeeper – Retired**Another Dortmund legend, Roman Weidenfeller was unfortunate to only total 5 international games for Germany, largely due to the wealth of goalkeeping talent they’ve had the pleasure of selecting from throughout the years.Having played for the black and yellow club from 2002 to 2018 he was the number one choice for many a year, until being overhauled by current keeper, Roman Bürki.Still on the payroll at the club, he continues to work for BVB as an international ambassador.**#23 – Christoph Kramer – Midfielder – Borussia Mönchengladbach**Last but absolutely not least, it’s the man who had the weirdest experience of the final by far.Starting his first game at the tournament due to Sami Khedira’s last minute injury, he suffered a concussion early in the match following a collision with Argentinian defender Garay, eventually being replaced by André Schürrle. The real kicker was that Kramer spent 14 minutes charging about the pitch in typical fashion before famously asking the referee whether it was the final that he was playing in, prompting his much-needed substitution. Providing strength and leadership in the centre of the park, Kramer now turns out for Mönchengladbach where he is soon to rack up a century of appearances.",0

"&gt;What was the difference between your exchange with Del Bosque and the one you suffered with Mourinho?The two situations were different. One was justified on a sporting level and the other was more on a personal level... We were two people who got along well for a year and a half and the next we had discrepancies, but they were normal between the team captain and the coach. It doesn't mean that you're more than the coach, but in the end you're going to clash because you have to talk to him practically every day and the relationship wears down.José Mourinho thought that I was not at the level of another teammate or, in addition, that our relationship was no longer so good and it was much easier for him to choose between one or the other. There are many things that people don't see, but with him I have a good relationship. We have seen each other several times since then and have had nice words. It's not a question of continuing to hold a grudge, everyone was looking out for the best for the team. I decided not to have such a relationship with him because I did not like the things I saw and he chose another partner. This last situation reached me much more mature, at 33 years old. You go around the club, you try not to create more controversy than there already was and, well, I would do the same thing I did in his day and I think I was not wrong.&gt;	What do you gather and what advice would you give people from that experience?Work, work, work. Luis Aragonés, who is one of the coaches who influenced me the most, told me that I didn’t have to look at the coach or my partner, that I had to look at myself and see what I could change to improve. If you do your job well and try to help people, you will surely be rewarded.&gt;	How did you experience the arrival of the so-called Galacticos to Real Madrid?It felt like Real Madrid was a blessed glory for any player. Florentino’s philosophy of being able to sign the best player of the moment was a plus of motivation for us. I remember that period in a very nice way, although in the last year of the Galacticos we didn’t have that fortune of winning titles, but from 2000 to 2003 we won two European Cups, two Leagues and an infinity of titles that made the coexistence more pleasant. Florentino knew how to take the club to the position that it currently has, in place, the most important team in history.&gt;	How is the pressure on Real Madrid?When I was playing in Madrid’s youth categories, even though we won 8-2, the coach told me how I let two goals go in. That within the academy was frowned upon, the pressure was already from the start and that made me carry the pressure to become the goalkeeper of the first team. I knew that every three days I had a responsibility, it is clear that it is not always easy to maintain the level, but it is true that I liked to play with that responsibility.&gt;How is life without soccer?   Life changes a lot. From having a routine and having daily chores, you have to reinvent yourself a little on a personal and professional level. I was lucky, I began to see two or three years ago that the soccer career was ending and when the heart attack happened a year and a half ago I practically had the road paved, it was already a question of getting it going sooner or later. Due to circumstances that have happened to me, it has had to be earlier, but I don’t have any problem because I am prepared for it.&gt;	An anecdote of your first trip with Real Madrid to play the Champions League?The funny thing is that I was in design class. I was talking to my colleagues, we were talking about Real Madrid, because they had been playing a series of matches in which they had not been well... We were talking with my friends about the last day, as soccer lovers we had the right to criticize those players and, curiously, before the break came, a janitor from the institute told the teacher that she had to leave class for a moment because they had to talk to me.At first I didn’t give it much thought, but when I walked 15 or 20 meters down the corridor I felt a bit nervous because I thought it might be unpleasant news, but no, he reassured me and told me that Real Madrid was asking me to go with them to play the Champions League. I was perplexed, I didn’t understand very well what he was telling me, I thought it was a joke. When I arrived with the director, he told me that he had been called because I had to join the club to go to Norway.I went from being a critic of the club to being part of them on a trip, to eating at a table with Clarence Seedorf, with Fernando Morientes, with Raúl González, with Davor Suker, with Roberto Carlos. It was like going to Disneyland, being with the team that won the seventh European Cup.___[Source]",0

However, the team was infested by Covid-19, with more than 20 players infected. It's a key match to Flamengo, who should play with their U20 and need a win in order to avoid the possibility of a *Maracanazzo* in the last round match.**Wednesday 30th, 9:30pm, Avellaneda (Argentina)**River Plate/ARGENTINA (2nd) vs. São Paulo/BRAZIL (3rd): it's *Miracle Day* for São Paulo, who need to beat the superior team of River Plate in Argentina, with an underperforming and decaying football.
