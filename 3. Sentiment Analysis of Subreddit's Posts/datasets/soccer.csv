The *Giallorossi* suffered the lack of their best striker, who had to be left out because of Market reasons, however Dzeko's situation has been solved, with *The Swan of Sarajevo* who now is almost sure of staying in Rome for at least one more season.**Predicted line-ups**&amp;#x200B;||||*Roma*|||||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|||||Mirante||||||||||||||Mancini||Ibanez||Kumbulla|||||||||||Santon||Pellegrini||Veretout||Spinazzola||||||||||||Pedro||Mkhitaryan|||||||||||||||Dzeko||||&amp;#x200B;||||*Juventus*|||||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|||||Szczesny||||||||||||||Danilo||Bonucci||Chiellini|||||||||||Cuadrado||McKennie||Rabiot||Frabotta|||||||||||||Ramsey|||||||||||||||Kulusevski||C.Ronaldo|||**KEY-PLAYERS**It's far too easy to name CR7, 31 goals, and 6 assists in the previous Serie A, the Portuguese remains a beast even at 35.On the other side of the pitch, Edin Dzeko surely is the first name that comes to mind. 16 goals and 11 assists for the Bozniak in his last Serie A season he will look forward starting this one with a bang.Besides the 2 strikers, it will be interesting to see how Pellegrini will behave in the center-mid position. Last year the Roman was one of Roma's main players in the first part of the season, but slowly faded away in his performances after winter.On the opposite side we might want to keep an eye on McKennie, his transfer went almost unnoticed, yet the young American is once again in the starting eleven for Juventus, after his terrific game against Sampdoria.Another key player for Roma will be Kumbulla, from his performance will probably depend on the way the match will unfold. The young defender has been on the radar of almost all of the big clubs in Italy, but even with his talent, it may prove difficult to adapt to the way the team plays in only 10 days.For Juve, a similar case can be made for Danilo who, while being an experienced player, has spent most of his career as a full-back rather than a CB. Against Sampdoria, his new position didn't end up bee√¨ing too much of an issue, who knows whether it will be the same against Roma.",0

"Julen Lopetegui started coaching after a steady career as a goalkeeper. He finished his career at Rayo Vallecano. He became the assistant for Spain¬¥s U17 and in the same year; he was also a caretaker for Rayo Vallecano. This all took place in 2003. He wouldn‚Äôt coach actively before 2008, where he took over Real Madrid‚Äôs B side. His work at Real Madrid became the start of his illustrious coaching career. After one year at Real Madrid B, he would leave Madrid and take over Spain‚Äôs U19. It was here he demonstrated the incredible 4-3-3 formation, which would be his main formation. Spain was dominating national team football at the time, and Lopetegui was a part of the Spanish domination by winning UEFA European under-19 Championship in 2012 and UEFA European Under-21 Championship in 2013. He was coaching Spain¬¥s U19 from 2010 to 2013, and he also coached Spain U21 from 2012 to 2014. His testimony with the youth teams was unbelievable with the record of 26-5-1.&amp;#x200B;[üì∑Lopetegui and Thiago after winning the EC for U21.

"When Saint-√âtienne-Rennes becomes the most anticipated match of the week, you know things have gotten a bit weird. Still, after three wins and a draw for each, there's nothing to say about the fact that those are the teams that have performed the best in the league so far and they fully deserve their position as coleaders.---# Appetizers* In a match that won't stay long in people's memory, Lille logically beat Nantes 2-0 at home, with the first goal from Burak Yilmaz and an own goal from Nicolas Pallois. The nordists are still one of the two teams unbeaten in the league and while they're not as well oiled offensively as last year, they are extremely consistent, an asset that not a lot of teams own.* The big match. The event the world turned on the TV to watch. Saint-√âtienne-Rennes. Well, that was a beating. Les Verts suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the bretons. Guirassy scored his third goal since his arrival, Aguerd proved again how good a recruit he was and Hunou, Rennes' very own Solksjaer, closed the debate for good. Saint-√âtienne was dominated the whole match. Obviously the Fofana situation didn't help but it can't be the only explanation. Rennes is just the better team.* Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, Metz concedes a late goal. For the third time this season in only five games, Metz lost precious points in the last five minutes. After a loss in Lille at the 88th minute, another in Paris at the 93rd, this time it was Marseille that equalized at the 95th with Morgan Sanson finishing a brilliant sequence. Those late goals represent already four points and for a team that will fight to avoid relegation it's already quite a lot. Marseille on the other hand continues to play like those are summer friendlies but gets rewarded somehow. Still, it's the third match without a win for the phoceans.* After taking no points in four matches, Dijon was that close from getting three at once against the ever struggling away from home Montpellier. Unfortunately, a foul from Panzo on Delort (who scored earlier on a great cross from Laborde) on the last minute allowed T√©ji Savanier to equalize.* Monaco continues their tradition of getting red cards left and right (2 in this match, 13 since the start of the last season). Fortunately, they have become competent at football again. Besides the loss against Rennes last week, Monaco have't conceded any defeat this season, winning 3 and drawing once while dominating their opponents most of the time. Ben Yedder scored twice, Aguilar being the other scorer for Monaco. Strasbourg relied on Chahiri and a penalty from Ajorque to keep the pressure on the men from le Rocher. That wasn't enough.* Lyon didn't manage to beat Lorient despite having the ball 70% of the time. At one point it was even looking like they would not get any point at all after Hamel got himself strangely alone then sent the ball to Wissa who put it right under the bar. But ten minutes later, the french international L√©o Dubois equalized on a Robben-like goal perfectly executed. That won't satisfy anyone in the club as Lyon concedes their 4th match in a row without a win, just like Lorient by the way, but obviously the ambition from both clubs are slightly different.* Getting to face PSG during a period of doubt is not the greatest gift you could ask. After being eliminated in Europa League qualifiers at the hands of the juggernaut MOL Feh√©rvar, Reims hosted the european vice-champion on sunday night and while they held their ground as they usually do against Paris, the talent on the other side was too much to contain. Mauro Icardi finally awakened and scored a brace after seven months without a goal. Granted Paris didn't play four months but still, it was getting seriously worrying. The score could have been far greater if not for a top performance from Rajkovic. Business as usual.---# Main Course### []",0

"On 16th December 1899, Nottingham-born footballer Herbert Kiplin founded Italian giants AC Milan. ‚ÄúWe will be a team of devils‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúOur colors will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents‚Äù. Over the past few years now, AC Milan has been a shadow of its former self, having won the Serie A way back in 2011. It‚Äôs been 9 years now and the Rossoneri is still struggling to compete with Europe‚Äôs finest. At the forefront to change the fortunes of the fallen Italian giant is another giant - American investment management firm Elliott Management. Founded in 1977 by Paul Singer after borrowing $1.3 million from friends and family, the Elliott Corporation is now worth $35 billion.Elliott Management has a kind of cult status in the investing world, with some calling it ‚Äúthe vulture fund‚Äù, and for good reason. A vulture fund is an investment fund that seeks out and buys securities in distressed investments, such as high-yield bonds in or near default, or equities that are in or near bankruptcy. This is exactly the kind of situation in which Paul Singer and Elliott Management swooped in to take-over the Milan-based club. In April 2017, Chinese businessman Li Yonghong acquired AC Milan for ‚Ç¨740m from former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs investment firm Fininvest, ending his two-decade-long tenure at the club. This acquisition was completed by Yonghong via Rossoneri Sports Investment Luxembourg, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created to acquire the Italian giants.  Yonghong had big hopes for the club. Part of his strategy was to leverage the club‚Äôs massive Chinese fan base and reshape the financial and organizational structure of the club. To execute his vision, Yonghong borrowed loans worth almost ‚Ç¨300m from Elliott Management with an interest rate of ~11%. A little over a year later in July 2018, Yonghong could not repay his debts losing around ‚Ç¨500m in equity, effectively ending his brief stint at the club. Elliott swooped in, acquiring 99.93% of the stakes of AC Milan for ‚Ç¨400m, half of what it was valued at just a few months earlier. **Project Milan 2.0**Elliott had a clear strategy for the club - raise the value of the club by winning matches on the pitch, make revenue off it, and sell for a healthy return. Over the past decade, the club‚Äôs annual revenues have hovered around the ‚Ç¨200m mark. For perspective, Juventus‚Äô annual return for the 2018-19 season was ‚Ç¨494m. This is ‚Ç¨94m more than what Elliott bought the entire club for. To solve this problem, the hedge fund first injected a sum of ‚Ç¨50m into AC Milan to shore up the club‚Äôs balance sheets.Elliott also appointed former Arsenal Chief Executive Ivan Gazidis as AC Milan‚Äôs new Chief Executive. It also brought in two more important people to the club. Club legend Paolo Maldini was brought in as Technical Director and Italian businessman Paolo Scaroni was brought in as Chairman. To scout players, former Arsenal executive, and LSE alumni Henrik Almstadt was tasked with identifying transfers. So was former AS Monaco head scout Geoffrey Moncada. Another company that played a part in the Milan takeover by Elliott Management is the private investment group, Blue Skye. Founded by Napoli-based businessmen Salvatore Cerchione and Gianluca D'Avanzo, the two are board members at the Rossoneri, with D‚ÄôAvanzo the Chief Financial Officer of the club. Both founders have had a long-standing relationship with former AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani. All three of them were on the board of SOPAF - a private equity firm that owned 50% of Blue Skye until 2006. They later sold these shares to another hedge fund DB Zwirn. On March 20, 2017, Blue Skye played its first part in the Li Hongyong takeover when it took control of the Luxembourg Investment Company - the entity that lent the money to Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux, Hongyong‚Äôs SPV. On April 4, 2017, the Luxembourg Investment Company changed its name to Project Redblack. On April 10, 2017, Blue Skye ceded control of Project Redblack to two SPVs owned by Elliott management, King George and Genio, in Delaware. Once Elliott gained control of AC Milan, Blue Skye was given a small piece of the AC Milan pie. **What now for Milan**For the 2018-19 season, the first under Elliott management, AC Milan suffered the worst result in the club‚Äôs history with its loss before tax amount increasing from ‚Ç¨121m to ‚Ç¨143m.Unsurprisingly, this was also the worst in Serie A by some margin. For perspective, Inter had a total pre-loss amount of ‚Ç¨40m and champions Juventus with ‚Ç¨27m. The highest profit margin was reported by Atalanta who made ‚Ç¨35m while also qualifying for the Champions League. One of the reasons for Milan‚Äôs poor numbers is the steep decline in profit on player sales - with the number falling a whopping ‚Ç¨23m from ‚Ç¨35m to ‚Ç¨12m. For perspective, Juventus generated profits worth almost 10x more with ‚Ç¨127m. In general, Milan has struggled with earning profits on player sales earning an average of ‚Ç¨11m profit a year since 2014. In the same time period, Juventus have made a profit of ‚Ç¨417m, Roma ‚Ç¨391m, and Inter ‚Ç¨185m. Despite Milan‚Äôs revenue rising 4% from ‚Ç¨220m to ‚Ç¨228m, it‚Äôs still less than half of Juventus who reported revenues worth ‚Ç¨494m and ‚Ç¨150m less than Inter‚Äôs ‚Ç¨370m. They are ahead of Napoli though, who reported revenues worth ‚Ç¨207m. However, things might be turning around for AC Milan. For instance, in the season recently completed (2019-20), Milan reduced their losses from ‚Ç¨143m to ‚Ç¨100m. Of these losses, ‚Ç¨20m is directly attributable to the COVID-19 outbreak. Unlike other clubs in Serie A, the Rossoneri have no debt on the bond markets or from banks. For comparison, Juventus, Inter, and AS Roma have taken credits or issued bonds worth over ‚Ç¨300m. This means that Milan is not answerable to any external investors or institutions. Its assets can also be easily liquidated as 100% of its shares can be sold for cash. Add to that its zero-debt, and Milan certainly appears a promising prospect for investors and sponsors. Plus the Zlatan effect isn‚Äôt too bad either. Could the Elliott formula be working?PS: If you're reading this far, please consider subscribing to [Weekend Beer]",0

FIFA rejected any appeal and Gro√ükreutz collected his paycheck before returning to Germany on January 6th without a single showing for the Turkish club. It was Stuttgart who bought him back home and the player looked happy to be back on the field, but the club were unable to retain their Bundesliga status, finishing 17th and being relegated for the first time in 41 years. The worst was yet to come though‚Ä¶Four days after being in a bar fight which saw he and a 16-year old be taken to hospital and a further four suspects arrested, the club terminated Kevin‚Äôs contract by mutual consent. ‚ÄúI made a mistake and for that I‚Äôm very sorry. I accept the consequences and regret that my time at Stuttgart has come to an end in this way,‚Äù said Gro√ükreutz before adding ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to do with football for the time being.‚ÄùOne month later, he signed for Darmstadt 98. Make of that what you will. Recently e was kicked out of Uerdingen and has now sued the club over outstanding salary payments. Additionally he has resigned as manager of Landesliga (6th tier) club T√ºrkspor Dortmund which he coached for a year. The man lives for the drama.**#3 ‚Äì Matthias Ginter ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Borussia M√∂nchengladbach**The youngest player on this list, Matthias Ginter was just 20 when he was selected for the World Cup squad following an impressive season with Freiburg.After the World Cup he signed for Borussia Dortmund before switching to his current club, M√∂nchengladbach, in 2017 where he has performed to a very strong level, helping the side return to the Champion‚Äôs League last season, a feat the side will be looking to repeat in the 20-21 campaign.**#4 ‚Äì Benedikt H√∂wedes ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Retired**Here he is then, the first of the retirees and a bonafide Schalke legend. H√∂wedes somewhat surprisingly featured in every single minute of the 2014 triumph, along with Neuer and captain Philipp Lahm ‚Äì he was exceptionally reliable and versatile, slotting into the left back role with ease and providing the solid performances expected of him throughout. He almost opened the scoring in the final too, his header cannoning off the post late in the first half, placing him centimeters from immortality.  Having racked up 240 professional games for Schalke, a vast number of which as captain, he departed on loan to Juventus in 2017. Sadly, the injuries had caught up with him incredibly quickly, resulting in H√∂wedes only being able to feature in 3 games for the Italian champions.A move to Lokomotiv Moscow followed, ending his 17-year affiliation with Schalke. After two seasons in Russia, the club and player agreed to terminate his contract by mutual consent due to family reasons with his retirement arriving less than two months later, on July 31st of this year. **#5 ‚Äì Mats Hummels ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Borussia Dortmund**Another sure-fire legend of the professional game; Mats Hummels has been a leader at the heart of every defensive line he‚Äôs featured within. Scoring a couple of goals at the tournament, including the vital winner against France in the quarters, Hummels was a shining light of this German era.A Bayern youth player, Mats made the unholy switch back to the champions in 2016 following over 200 games for BVB. There, he would win three league titles, adding to his two previous collected with Dortmund, before making the ¬£30 million return to the yellow and black, where he remains today, having had a wonderful season back towards the peak of his elegant defensive powers. Most noteworthy however, is that he was one of three veteran players (alongside J√©r√¥me Boateng and Thomas M√ºller) who L√∂w would no longer be considering for selection as of 2019. Many have questioned this decision, especially given Germany‚Äôs less-than-consistent performances over the past couple of years, but the finger sniffer has held firm, and Hummels hasn‚Äôt featured in the national side since 2018.**#6 ‚Äì Sami Khedira ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Juventus**The ticking midfield maestro at the heart of the 2014 midfield, Khedira had another exceptional tournament to follow on from his 2010 success which saw him move to Real Madrid, where he won everything Spanish football has to offer. As his contract expired with Madrid, he was picked up by Juventus, in typical free transfer fashion. A consistent performer in Italy, introducing others into play delightfully, he‚Äôs managed a tidy amount of goals over his five-year Italian tenure too.Injuries have really started to ramp up however, and his legs are getting heavier on the field, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to see him depart The Old Lady come the end of his contract in summer.**#7 ‚Äì Bastian Schweinsteiger ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Retired**Rightly hailed by Joachim L√∂w as one of the greatest footballers Germany has ever produced, Bastian Schweinsteiger enjoyed an illustrious career at Bayern Munich, racking up 500 games across all competitions and playing a variety of important roles through the years.For many, he was man of the match in the 2014 final. Man-marking Messi out of the game for massive periods, controlling the midfield and launching attacks from deep ‚Äì without him, the result could have been very different. Truly his finest hour.Post World Cup injury issues became ever clearer (this is becoming a bit of a theme, isn‚Äôt it), and with his career in Germany winding down, a switch to Louis van Gaal‚Äôs Manchester United army ensued. Sadly though, he struggled to pick up the pace the side demanded, and it never really felt like he achieved what was hoped of him at Old Trafford. Mourinho‚Äôs arrival spelt the end for the German, being harshly treated and effectively pushed out of the squad and placed on the unwanted list.As a result, he moved to Chicago Fire in the MLS and performed really well, seemingly having a new lease of life as he looked to guide the club to World Cup victory, if some journalists are to be believed‚Ä¶Retirement in 2019 followed and he now works as a pundit, casting his footballing brain across the airwaves.**#8 ‚Äì Mesut √ñzil ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Arsenal**During the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, and for every season in between, Mesut √ñzil was one of the finest players on the planet; a serial assister who glided across the pitch with craftsmenship and fluidity like no other, he was the heartbeat of the attack for Germany, Real Madrid and Arsenal.Having experienced massive success at Werder Bremen and Real Madrid, his move to Arsenal in 2013 was met with glee, as another giant of the game was set to make a splash in the Premier League ‚Äì and splash he did. It‚Äôs easy to forget due to Arsenal‚Äôs turgid recent years, that for many years √ñzil way THE man for Arsenal. Nowadays, he‚Äôs sometimes not even bench warming, and instead is smashing Fortnite whilst collecting his ¬£350,000 per week and failing to make any sort of impact within the plans of Arteta and Unai Emery before him.The real controversy lies in his retirement from the national team though. After being pictured with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan (along with ƒ∞lkay G√ºndoƒüan) fans were outraged, as the image was seen as an endorsement of the president‚Äôs highly controversial policies. The DFB publicly distance themselves from the situation, but following a frankly horrendous 2018 World Cup campaign, the issue reared its head again.√ñzil addressed the concerns, stating that they solely discussed football, not politics, and that he was simply respecting the office of his family‚Äôs nation. He even battled back by zoning in on a potential lack of criticism received by Lothar Matth√§us, who had met with Russian president Vladimir Putin before going on to accuse Reinhard Grindel, the DFB president, of racism. He promptly stepped down from the nation side in protest of his treatment, sparking yet more criticism in the direction of the Arsenal attacking midfielder. Nothing has changed since, but there was that occasion in 2019 when Erdoƒüan was best man at √ñzil‚Äôs wedding. I‚Äôm sure they only spoke about football though‚Ä¶**#9 ‚Äì Andr√© Sch√ºrrle ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Retired**The man who assisted that famous winning goal, Andr√© Sch√ºrrle, has experienced a turbulent career following the World Cup win. Leaving Chelsea in 2015 having never cemented his place in the starting line-up, he moved to Wolfsburg for approximately ¬£22 million, performing to a high level in the green shirt and pushing him back towards the very top of his game. The result, a move to Borussia Dortmund for another sizeable fee but again his career took a nosedive. Injuries struck, and alongside it, poor performances.A loan move to Fulham showed promise, including a banging goal against Burnley, but he wasn‚Äôt the player Premier League had witnessed 4 years prior as Fulham dropped down to the Championship at the first time of asking. Another loan to Spartak Moscow failed to spark an upturn in form and retirement followed at just 29 years of age, with Sch√ºrrle stating that he no longer wanted to face the loneliness and endless competition of top-tier football.A beauty to watch on his day, it‚Äôs a real shame he never quite acheievd what was anticipated of him. At least we‚Äôll always have that assist, and that performance against Brazil in the infamous 7-1, everyone else had downed tools, but Sch√ºrrle, brilliantly, was having none of that.**#10 ‚Äì Lukas Podolski ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Antalyaspor** Despite playing a bit-part in this crowning moment for his country, Lukas Podolski will live long in the memory of German fans, with wonderful World Cup campaigns in both 2006 and 2010 and a team of the tournament appearance at Euro 2008.The King of K√∂ln, possessing unreal speed a foot like a traction engine, often saved his very best for the German national side, and is a cult hero for many across the globe.Having played in Germany, England, Italy and Japan and now Turkey with Antalyaspor, the man is best known for his dual spells at FC K√∂ln where he racked up a mightily impressive 79 league goals, using his explosive pace to maximum effect in the Bundesliga.Nowadays, when he‚Äôs not appearing in the Turkish S√ºper Lig, he putting his well-earned cash to a good cause, having founded the Lukas Podolski Foundation for Sport and Education which aims to give prospects to disadvantaged children and young people, fight child poverty, and promote social inclusion and integration and understanding among nations.**#11 ‚Äì Miroslav Klose ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Retired**I simply cannot do this man justice in words. The all-time leading goal scorer in World Cup history, having converted in the famous 7-1 demolition of Brazil (surpassing Ronaldo Naz√°rio‚Äôs as he went), Klose retired from the national side following his greatest triumph. Whilst well-regarded as a scoring machine for both club and country, he is often boxed in as simply an aerial threat when in reality, he is far more than that. Possessing a rapid change of pace, strong build-up abilities and ultimately, some of the finest movement you‚Äôre ever likely to see, Klose was a complete striker. Plus, he could even pull off a somersault celebration, and what‚Äôs not to love about that.Spending almost his entire club career in Germany, he eventually retired at Lazio with, as expected, a solid scoring record.Having been part of the national side‚Äôs coaching set-up, he is now second-in-command to the incredible Hansi Flick at Bayern, where his tactical nous is certain to help him to flourish into a blooming boss in future.  **#12 ‚Äì Ron-Robert Zieler ‚Äì Goalkeeper ‚Äì FC K√∂ln**Imagine making your professional debut with Northampton Town and ending up in a World Cup winning squad. That‚Äôd be bloody mint.A Manchester United youth prospect, Zieler carved out a fantastic career for himself. The goalkeeper made over 200 appearances across two spells for Hannover and had a strong season with Stuttgart before a second tricky term, when he scored a calamitous own goal against Bremen. Caught out pulling his socks up when a throw-in came his way, he miscontrolled the ball and was forced to dive in vain as the ball trickled into the net. If that isn‚Äôt legacy, I don‚Äôt know what is.Now he sits happily on the bench for FC K√∂ln, but if Timo Horn continues his current form, he could find himself between the sticks once more. **#13 ‚Äì Thomas M√ºller ‚Äì Forward ‚Äì Bayern Munich**The Bundesliga champion, assist master, space-invader, world cup top scorer, Germany centurion. What can be said about M√ºller that hasn‚Äôt been already. He‚Äôs perennially underrated, being one of the finest and most consistent players of a generation. Aged just 24 when the 2014 contest rolled around, he had already accumulated 49 international appearances, and followed on from his destruction of England and Argentina in 2010 with another 5 goals at the finals, pairing a silver boot with his previous gold in South Africa.The man has hardly missed a beat since, with his only real blip coinciding with the turbulent tenure of Niko Kovaƒç. Now at 30 years of age, he‚Äôs leading Bayern to yet more league glory, with this year‚Äôs Champion‚Äôs League being a cherry atop his sporting cake. As mentioned earlier however, M√ºller has been frozen out of the Germany squad by Joachim L√∂w, seemingly one of the scapegoats of the group stage exit in Russia. He stated that he was ‚Äúangry and surprised‚Äù by the dropping of himself and his fellow teammates and given his incredible form (particularly this past season) it is more than understandable as to why.**#14 ‚Äì Julian Draxler ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Paris Saint-Germain**Destined for great things was young Julian. You‚Äôd have found him floating around the top of many a top prospect lists around the time of the tournament in Brazil; and whilst he‚Äôs had a more than respectable career in many a sense, he hasn‚Äôt truly hit the heights expected of him during those early Schalke days.After moving onto Wolsburg for a hefty sum, it felt like Draxler was set to kick his career into the upper gears, helping the club reach the Champion‚Äôs League quarter finals for the first time ever. However, the club felt he had not met up to the lofty expectations and Draxler duly wished to move on. Offers arrived but it would take until Christmas Eve later that year when PSG would stump up ‚Ç¨42 million to secure his services, ending what the midfielders described as ‚Äúthe worst first half of a season of my career.‚ÄùHe only made 20 appearances across all competitions for the French capital club in the previous term, without registering a single goal. Maybe the farmers have too much for him and again, it may be time to move on.**#15 ‚Äì Erik Durm ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Eintracht Frankfurt**When I heard Huddersfield Town were signing former World Cup winning defender you better believe my fantasy football senses were tingling off the charts.The tingling was short lived. Huddersfield finished bottom and Durm was an absolute shadow of the player many Yorkshire fans had expected. But enough about the bad part, let‚Äôs hear some good.With BVB he had some good times, racking up a tidy half century of appearances in the yellow and black, and now he‚Äôs back in the Bundesliga with Frankfurt where he hopes to reignite his career on home soil.**#16 ‚Äì Philipp Lahm ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Retired** Captaining a side as gargantuan as this is no easy task, and there aren‚Äôt too many captains that measure up to the golden goose that is Philipp Lahm. Lahm was the ultimate in high-level versatility, playing in the back line and midfield, with technical ability and tackling acumen on either foot ‚Äì he‚Äôs also one of the most tactically intelligent players I‚Äôve ever had the joy of watching, always appearing in the correct position and barely breaking stride to disrupt opposition moves. At the World Cup he was imperious, starring in multiple positions and staking his claim as one of the best players at the tournament. Watching him lift the trophy (a first for unified Germany) was a joy to be hold and the highlight of a career that included a multitude of awards.Should he move into management, I have no doubt he would be a success, given his second-to-none understanding of the game. Plus, he‚Äôs a wonderful man, helping to support a number of charities and advocating for tolerance of homosexuality in football.**#17 ‚Äì Per Mertesacker ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Retired**Back in the day Per Mertesacker was one of the most effective centre backs in Europe. At Hannover and Werder Bremen he established himself as a sensible centre back with an exceptional understanding of the game and disciplinary record. Obviously dominant in the air (being a whopping 6 foot 7) it is often forgotten how cool the man was with the ball at his feet ‚Äì sure, he has a lack of pace, but was rarely caught out in the Bundesliga or internationally.At the German World Cup in 2006, the 2008 Euros and the 2010 World Cup Mertesacker was a regular feature, showing a strong partnership with Christian Metzelder at the heart of defence. The emergence of Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber and J√©r√¥me Boateng ultimately played into the stepping back of Mertesacker, but he‚Äôll be fondly remembered at international level.At Arsenal, he was a great leader and player, but injuries derailed his later years. His performance in the 2017 FA Cup final will live long in the memory ‚Äì having not started all season, he rolled back the years and put in a titanic performance, leading Arsenal to yet another FA Cup triumph. He‚Äôs still at Arsenal now, as he manages the academy and continues to showcase his professionalism and desire to the next generation. **#18 ‚Äì Toni Kroos ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Real Madrid**You obviously don‚Äôt win the World Cup nowadays without a premium squad, but the stacked level of this squad this squad is just absurd.   At the time of the tournament Kroos was still a Bayern player, moving to Madrid shortly after and continuing his meteoric to the top of the midfield tree. His incredible performance in that 7-1 demolition was a huge statement on the biggest stage, yet he still somehow moved for just under ¬£30 million. One of the transfers of the millennium without a doubt.He‚Äôs been a constant at the spine of the side since, forming a fruitful relationship with both Casemiro and Modric, helping to capture La Decima, the first of a hattrick of Champion‚Äôs League trophies for Toni in white.And he‚Äôs still doing it to this day, dictating tempo, snaffling attacks and scoring the occasional banger (see Germany v Sweden at the Russia World Cup), simply put, he can do it all and we‚Äôre incredibly lucky to be able to witness a player of his calibre week in, week out.**#19 ‚Äì Mario G√∂tze ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Free Agent**From a talent fully realised, to one who was destined for so much more.After coming off the bench in the final and quite brilliantly squeezing home the winning extra time goal G√∂tze had punched a one-way ticket to mega stardom, individual awards and championship glory throughout his career. And whilst much of this success reigns true, the train much have gotten a little lost en route to the destination. A mixture of less-than-incredible form and ultimately, a metabolic disorder which causes the fibres of the muscles to not function correct, meant young Mario pulled into the station a few stops short of the all-time greats. Now he‚Äôs a free agent, and the versatile forward could be of some use to a number of Bundesliga sides, depending on who can afford his wage demands. Who knows what the future will hold for the 28 year old, but I‚Äôm sure everyone hopes he‚Äôll be able to somehow rediscover that electric form that put him on the roadmap in the first place. **#20 ‚Äì J√©r√¥me Boateng ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Bayern Munich**The younger brother of Ghana‚Äôs Kevin Prince-Boateng, J√©r√¥me backed his abilities when leaving Manchester City in search of more playing time in central defence, rather the being farmed out at right back. People weren‚Äôt sure he was good enough, but not only did he talk the talk, he walked the walk, ran the run and showed everyone in England exactly what they had been missing, becoming one of the most decorated defenders the game has ever seen along the way.Sure, there have been some downs (mainly Kovaƒç dropping him and Messi imploding his ankles with the force of one thousand suns) but its been a career in Germany full of ups, including last season. With David Alaba moving to centre back, Boateng was imperious, cleaning up attacks and helping build from the base of Bayern‚Äôs traditional 4-2-3-1, helping the side add yet another European trophy to their illustrious cabinet. This year will be more of a challenge than the last given Flick‚Äôs pancake-thin squad, but Boateng will likely shine once again before inevitably moving to Manchester United as his decline hits.**#21 ‚Äì Shkodran Mustafi ‚Äì Defender ‚Äì Arsenal**Everton &gt; Sampdoria &gt; Valencia &gt; Arsenal ‚Äì Shkodran Mustafi has had quite the memorable career path thus far. Eligible to represent Germany, North Macedonia and Albania, Mustafi made the right choice in opting to appear for his birth nation, appearing as a substitute throughout the 2014 tournament, and getting his hands on sport‚Äôs greatest prize.Following the tournament, he moved to Spain and was one of the standout centre backs in La Liga, hence why Arsenal came sniffing for his signature. Surprising as it may be, he hasn‚Äôt always been the meme player he is now and he‚Äôs definitely shown a return to form under Arteta, whether he‚Äôs the standard they require anymore remains to be see, but this season will likely tell all.**#22 ‚Äì Roman Weidenfeller ‚Äì Goalkeeper ‚Äì Retired**Another Dortmund legend, Roman Weidenfeller was unfortunate to only total 5 international games for Germany, largely due to the wealth of goalkeeping talent they‚Äôve had the pleasure of selecting from throughout the years.Having played for the black and yellow club from 2002 to 2018 he was the number one choice for many a year, until being overhauled by current keeper, Roman B√ºrki.Still on the payroll at the club, he continues to work for BVB as an international ambassador.**#23 ‚Äì Christoph Kramer ‚Äì Midfielder ‚Äì Borussia M√∂nchengladbach**Last but absolutely not least, it‚Äôs the man who had the weirdest experience of the final by far.Starting his first game at the tournament due to Sami Khedira‚Äôs last minute injury, he suffered a concussion early in the match following a collision with Argentinian defender Garay, eventually being replaced by Andr√© Sch√ºrrle. The real kicker was that Kramer spent 14 minutes charging about the pitch in typical fashion before famously asking the referee whether it was the final that he was playing in, prompting his much-needed substitution. Providing strength and leadership in the centre of the park, Kramer now turns out for M√∂nchengladbach where he is soon to rack up a century of appearances.",0

"&gt;What was the difference between your exchange with Del Bosque and the one you suffered with Mourinho?The two situations were different. One was justified on a sporting level and the other was more on a personal level... We were two people who got along well for a year and a half and the next we had discrepancies, but they were normal between the team captain and the coach. It doesn't mean that you're more than the coach, but in the end you're going to clash because you have to talk to him practically every day and the relationship wears down.Jos√© Mourinho thought that I was not at the level of another teammate or, in addition, that our relationship was no longer so good and it was much easier for him to choose between one or the other. There are many things that people don't see, but with him I have a good relationship. We have seen each other several times since then and have had nice words. It's not a question of continuing to hold a grudge, everyone was looking out for the best for the team. I decided not to have such a relationship with him because I did not like the things I saw and he chose another partner. This last situation reached me much more mature, at 33 years old. You go around the club, you try not to create more controversy than there already was and, well, I would do the same thing I did in his day and I think I was not wrong.&gt;	What do you gather and what advice would you give people from that experience?Work, work, work. Luis Aragon√©s, who is one of the coaches who influenced me the most, told me that I didn‚Äôt have to look at the coach or my partner, that I had to look at myself and see what I could change to improve. If you do your job well and try to help people, you will surely be rewarded.&gt;	How did you experience the arrival of the so-called Galacticos to Real Madrid?It felt like Real Madrid was a blessed glory for any player. Florentino‚Äôs philosophy of being able to sign the best player of the moment was a plus of motivation for us. I remember that period in a very nice way, although in the last year of the Galacticos we didn‚Äôt have that fortune of winning titles, but from 2000 to 2003 we won two European Cups, two Leagues and an infinity of titles that made the coexistence more pleasant. Florentino knew how to take the club to the position that it currently has, in place, the most important team in history.&gt;	How is the pressure on Real Madrid?When I was playing in Madrid‚Äôs youth categories, even though we won 8-2, the coach told me how I let two goals go in. That within the academy was frowned upon, the pressure was already from the start and that made me carry the pressure to become the goalkeeper of the first team. I knew that every three days I had a responsibility, it is clear that it is not always easy to maintain the level, but it is true that I liked to play with that responsibility.&gt;How is life without soccer?   Life changes a lot. From having a routine and having daily chores, you have to reinvent yourself a little on a personal and professional level. I was lucky, I began to see two or three years ago that the soccer career was ending and when the heart attack happened a year and a half ago I practically had the road paved, it was already a question of getting it going sooner or later. Due to circumstances that have happened to me, it has had to be earlier, but I don‚Äôt have any problem because I am prepared for it.&gt;	An anecdote of your first trip with Real Madrid to play the Champions League?The funny thing is that I was in design class. I was talking to my colleagues, we were talking about Real Madrid, because they had been playing a series of matches in which they had not been well... We were talking with my friends about the last day, as soccer lovers we had the right to criticize those players and, curiously, before the break came, a janitor from the institute told the teacher that she had to leave class for a moment because they had to talk to me.At first I didn‚Äôt give it much thought, but when I walked 15 or 20 meters down the corridor I felt a bit nervous because I thought it might be unpleasant news, but no, he reassured me and told me that Real Madrid was asking me to go with them to play the Champions League. I was perplexed, I didn‚Äôt understand very well what he was telling me, I thought it was a joke. When I arrived with the director, he told me that he had been called because I had to join the club to go to Norway.I went from being a critic of the club to being part of them on a trip, to eating at a table with Clarence Seedorf, with Fernando Morientes, with Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez, with Davor Suker, with Roberto Carlos. It was like going to Disneyland, being with the team that won the seventh European Cup.___[Source]",0

"From Tuesday 29th to Thursday 1st will happen the 5th Group Stage round of the 2020 Copa Libertadores. All times below are Brazil-set (GMT -3)**Tuesday 29th, 7:15pm, Arena do Gr√™mio (Brazil)**Gr√™mio/BRAZIL (2nd) vs. Universidad Cat√≥lica/CHILE (4th): the Brazilians have been having an awful season, with a lazy and uncompromised football. Gr√™mio fans are hoping the team will change the mindset in this encounter at home, instead of *keep pushing thing with their belly* as they have been doing. Keep an eye in Pep√™, the *""new Everton Cebolinha""*, in Gr√™mio side.**Tuesday 29th, 9:30pm, Pascual Guerrero (Colombia)**Am√©rica de Cali/COLOMBIA (3rd) vs. Internacional/BRAZIL (1st): it's a *live or die* match for the Colombians, who will play against a decaying Internacional. The Brazilians should be happy with a tie, while Am√©rica de Cali need a win to keep the hopes up in the cup.**Tuesday 29th 9:30pm, Arena da Baixada (Brazil)**Athletico/BRAZIL (1st) vs. Jorge Wilstermann/BOLIVIA (2nd): the Brazilians managed to beat the Bolivians 3-2 in the high altitude, so nothing but a victory is expected in Brazil. However, the weak performance of Athletico in the Brazilian League brings some doubts about their capacity to win.**Wednesday 30th, 7:15pm, Allianz Parque (Brazil)**Palmeiras/BRAZIL (1st) vs. Bol√≠var/BOLIVIA (3rd): Palmeiras are still undefeated in the Copa Libertadores, and managed to win Boliviar in the difficult altitude of Bolivia. Despite playing an ugly/defensive football, Palmeiras fans are expecting a solid win.**Wednesday 30th, 9:30pm, Maracan√£ (Brazil)**Flamengo/BRAZIL (2nd) vs. Independiente del Valle/ECUADOR (1st): a rematch after the 5-0 humilation suffered by Flamengo, now at home. However, the team was infested by Covid-19, with more than 20 players infected. It's a key match to Flamengo, who should play with their U20 and need a win in order to avoid the possibility of a *Maracanazzo* in the last round match.**Wednesday 30th, 9:30pm, Avellaneda (Argentina)**River Plate/ARGENTINA (2nd) vs. S√£o Paulo/BRAZIL (3rd): it's *Miracle Day* for S√£o Paulo, who need to beat the superior team of River Plate in Argentina, with an underperforming and decaying football. If S√£o Paulo don't win, they will be out of the Copa Libertadores, so get ready for a tense night.**Thursday 1st, 7pm, Manuel Ferreira (Paraguay)**Olimpia/PARAGUAY (3rd) vs. Santos/BRAZIL (1st): the Paraguayans need a win to keep their chances in the cup, while Santos are on a more comfortable situation. The last match between both teams was a boring 0-0, but hopes are high for a more cheerful match, given Olimpia situation and Santos offensive style.You can watch these matches from abroad at the paid service Fanatiz (7.99 USD).Actual Copa Libertadores table:r/futebol",0
