### Problem Statement

With a large amount of collected data about characteristics of houses in Ames, we would like to find out the underlying reasons and motivations for an important consideration
of every house owner: **Cost of House**. One way of doing so is train a model that takes these features as inputs, where it recognizes and weighs the influence of fed features
on our resultant output which in particular is the `SalePrice` and provide predictions of houses that share the same characterisitics. Therefore we aim to derive the **optimum model**
that gives the **most accurate predictions** when compared to the actual house prices in our past data. With such a versatile model, it would be helpful and viable to a wide range of
consumers as it not only provides an accurate prediction of housing prices for home buyers but also equip home sellers with the knowledge on maximizing their profit margins through
leveraging on certain qualities that strongly influence housing prices.

### Executive Summary
Cleaning and analyzing the given data have formed the biggest bulk of this project as the features chosen as inputs have a large influence on the output of the model. The huge presence 
of null values has warranted the removal of several features that would not have meaningful contributions to our target variable `SalePrice` since most of the values are missing. Through
 the analysis of over 50 features, several important variables stood out in terms of its correlation with our target variable and such features include `Overall Qual`, `Gr Liv Area` and
 interestingly the number of `Garage Cars`. The strong correlations established warranted our attention on several outliers which would have skewed our model significantly and therefore 
were carefully selected and removed. After imputing numerical values and encoding categorical values on selected features, the same set of modified and regularized variables were fed into 
several models with different parameters in hopes of deriving the optimal model which gives us predictions that are the closest to the actual data through the metrics such as root mean 
square error(RMSE). Ultimately, the optimal model which gives us the **lowest RMSE and highest r2 score** was the **Lasso model**. This optimized model would be highly versatile due to 
its applicability to both home owners and sellers who are either looking to **minimize their expenditure on such a necessity** or to **maximize their profits when selling their properties.**

### Conclusion/Recommendations
Based on the findings, we can draw several conclusions: <br>

1) Several important determining features of cost of houses:
- There are several features that have displayed a strong correlation and influence on our predictor variable and the top 5 features to look out for are `gr_liv_area`, `overall_qual`, `total_bsmt_sf`,`bsmtfin_sf_1` and `year_built`
- Higher cost of houses associated with larger houses
- Extended to both categorical(`kitchen_qual` and `neighborhood`) and numerical features
2) Versatility of model: Provision of accurate **quantitative increment** in housing prices for every unit change in the variables included.
- The use of a regularized linear regression model, Lasso, to weigh and highlight the impact of several important features on the cost of houses. 
3) Inclusion of most features results in a model with low bias and high variance with regards to houses in Ames,Iowa
- Strongly generalizable to houses in Ames, Iowa

Limitations of model: <br>

1) Biasness of features collected:
- Inclusion of subjective features such as `overall_qual` and `kitchenqual` reduces the reproducibility of predictions obtained
2) Exclusion of current housing challenges:
- Influx of university students and employees increases the population size over the years, leading to a lack of space and reducetion in the number of houses built and thus the trend that has been seen in the past few years might not be relevant to the future if such considerations are not taken into account.
